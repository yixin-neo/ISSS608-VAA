They are igraph, tidygraph, ggraph and visNetwork. Beside these four packages, tidyverse and [lubridate](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/), an R package specially designed to handle and wrangling **time** data will be installed and launched too.\n\nThe code chunk:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\npacman::p_load(igraph, tidygraph, ggraph,\n               visNetwork, lubridate, clock,\n               tidyverse, graphlayouts,knitr)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## 27.3 The Data\n\nThe data sets used in this hands-on exercise is from an oil exploration and extraction company. There are two data sets. One contains the nodes data and the other contains the edges (also know as link) data.\n\n### 27.3.1 The edges data\n\n-   *GAStech-email_edges.csv* which consists of two weeks of 9063 emails correspondances between 55 employees.\n\n![](https://r4va.netlify.app/chap27/img/image2.jpg)\n\n### 27.3.2 The nodes data\n\n-   *GAStech_email_nodes.csv* which consist of the names, department and title of the 55 employees.\n\n![](https://r4va.netlify.app/chap27/img/image1.jpg)\n\n### 27.3.3 Importing network data from files\n\nIn this step, you will import GAStech_email_node.csv and GAStech_email_edges-v2.csv into RStudio environment by using `read_csv()` of **readr** package.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nGAStech_nodes <- read_csv('data/GAStech_email_node.csv')\nGAStech_edges <- read_csv('data/GAStech_email_edge-v2.csv')\n```\n:::\n\n\n### 27.3.4 Reviewing the imported data\n\nNext, we will examine the structure of the data frame using *glimpse()* of **dplyr**.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nglimpse(GAStech_edges)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRows: 9,063\nColumns: 8\n$ source      <dbl> 43, 43, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 26, 26, 26…\n$ target      <dbl> 41, 40, 51, 52, 53, 45, 44, 46, 48, 49, 47, 54, 27, 28, 29…\n$ SentDate    <chr> \"6/1/2014\", \"6/1/2014\", \"6/1/2014\", \"6/1/2014\", \"6/1/2014\"…\n$ SentTime    <time> 08:39:00, 08:39:00, 08:58:00, 08:58:00, 08:58:00, 08:58:0…\n$ Subject     <chr> \"GT-SeismicProcessorPro Bug Report\", \"GT-SeismicProcessorP…\n$ MainSubject <chr> \"Work related\", \"Work related\", \"Work related\", \"Work rela…\n$ sourceLabel <chr> \"Sven.Flecha\", \"Sven.Flecha\", \"Kanon.Herrero\", \"Kanon.Herr…\n$ targetLabel <chr> \"Isak.Baza\", \"Lucas.Alcazar\", \"Felix.Resumir\", \"Hideki.Coc…\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\n# list()\n# summary()\n# class ()\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-warning\nThe output report of GAStech_edges above reveals that the *SentDate* is treated as \"Character\" data type instead of *date* data type.

[lubridate](https://r4va.netlify.app/cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lubridate/vignettes/lubridate.html) is an R package that makes it easier to work with dates and times.\n\n-   *dmy()* transforms the SentDate to Date data type.\n\n-   *wday()* returns the day of the week as a decimal number (1-7) or an ordered factor (Monday, Tuesday,..) if label is TRUE. The argument abbr is FALSE keep the daya spells in full, i.e. Monday. The function will create a new column in the data.frame i.e. Weekday and the output of *wday()* will save in this newly created field.\n\n-   the values in the *Weekday* field are in ordinal scale.\n:::\n\n### 27.3.6 Reviewing the revised date fields\n\nTable below shows the data structure of the reformatted *GAStech_edges* with the correct data formats.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRows: 9,063\nColumns: 9\n$ source      <dbl> 43, 43, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 26, 26, 26…\n$ target      <dbl> 41, 40, 51, 52, 53, 45, 44, 46, 48, 49, 47, 54, 27, 28, 29…\n$ SentDate    <date> 2014-01-06, 2014-01-06, 2014-01-06, 2014-01-06, 2014-01-0…\n$ SentTime    <time> 08:39:00, 08:39:00, 08:58:00, 08:58:00, 08:58:00, 08:58:0…\n$ Subject     <chr> \"GT-SeismicProcessorPro Bug Report\", \"GT-SeismicProcessorP…\n$ MainSubject <chr> \"Work related\", \"Work related\", \"Work related\", \"Work rela…\n$ sourceLabel <chr> \"Sven.Flecha\", \"Sven.Flecha\", \"Kanon.Herrero\", \"Kanon.Herr…\n$ targetLabel <chr> \"Isak.Baza\", \"Lucas.Alcazar\", \"Felix.Resumir\", \"Hideki.Coc…\n$ Weekday     <ord> Monday, Monday, Monday, Monday, Monday, Monday, Monday, Mo…\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### 27.3.7 Wrangling attributes\n\nA close examination of *GAStech_edges* data.frame reveals that it consists of individual e-mail flow records. This is not very useful for visualisation.\n\nIn view of this, we will\n\n-   filter `Work related` emails\n\n-   group-by senders, receivers and day of week\n\n-   aggregate to get the total count of each unique combination of the above to get `Weight` as a new column\n\n-   filter twice to remove self-loops and edges that occurred only once\n\n-   **`ungroup()`** function is used to remove the grouping created by **`group_by()`** so that the resulting dataframe is not grouped by any variable(s) anymore. This is useful when we want to apply further operations or analysis to the individual rows of data rather than grouped results.\n\nThe code chunk:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nGAStech_edges_aggregated <- GAStech_edges %>%  # after filter 6935 rows remain\n  filter(MainSubject=='Work related') %>% \n  group_by(source, target, Weekday) %>% \n  summarise(Weight = n()) %>%           # 3706 rows remaining and Weight col added\n  filter(source != target) %>%          #3493 rows remaining\n  filter(Weight >1) %>%                # 1456 rows remaining\n  ungroup()                            # 1456 x 4 columns \n```\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-note\n## Things to learn from code above\n\n-   four functions from **dplyr** package are used. They are: *filter()*, *group()*, *summarise()*, and *ungroup()*.\n\n-   The output data.frame is called **GAStech_edges_aggregated**.\n\n-   A new field called *Weight* has been added in GAStech_edges_aggregated.\n\n-   After ungroup(), we can analyse row by row instead of by unique combination of source, target and weekday\n:::\n\n### 27.3.8 Reviewing the revised edges file\n\nTable below shows the data structure of the reformatted *GAStech_edges_aggregated* data frame\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRows: 1,456\nColumns: 4\n$ source  <dbl> 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,…\n$ target  <dbl> 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7,…\n$ Weekday <ord> Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday…\n$ Weight  <int> 4, 3, 5, 8, 4, 3, 5, 8, 4, 3, 5, 8, 4, 3, 5, 8, 4, 3, 5, 8, 4,…\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## 27.4 Creating network objects using **tidygraph**\n\nIn this section, I will learn how to create a graph data model by using **tidygraph** package. It provides a tidy API for graph/network manipulation. While network data itself is not tidy, it can be envisioned as two tidy tables, one for node data and one for edge data. `tidygraph` provides a way\n\n-   to switch between the two tables and provides dplyr verbs for manipulating them.\n\n-   to access to a lot of graph algorithms with return values that facilitate their use in a tidy workflow.\n\nBefore getting started, please read these two articles:\n\n-   [Introducing tidygraph](https://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/introducing-tidygraph/)\n\n-   [tidygraph 1.1 - A tidy hope](https://www.data-imaginist.com/2018/tidygraph-1-1-a-tidy-hope/)\n\n### 27.4.1 The **tbl_graph** object\n\nTwo functions of **tidygraph** package can be used to create network objects, they are:\n\n-   [`tbl_graph()`](https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/tbl_graph.html) **creates** a **tbl_graph** network object from nodes and edges data.\n\n-   [`as_tbl_graph()`](https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/tbl_graph.html) **converts** network data and objects to a **tbl_graph** network. Below are network data and objects supported by `as_tbl_graph()`\n\n    -   a node data.frame and an edge data.frame,\n\n    -   data.frame, list, matrix from base,\n\n    -   igraph from igraph,\n\n    -   network from network,\n\n    -   dendrogram and hclust from stats,\n\n    -   Node from data.tree,\n\n    -   phylo and evonet from ape, and\n\n    -   graphNEL, graphAM, graphBAM from graph (in Bioconductor).\n\n### 27.4.2 The **dplyr** verbs in **tidygraph**\n\n-   *activate()* verb from **tidygraph** serves as a switch between tibbles for nodes and edges. All dplyr verbs applied to **tbl_graph** object are applied to the active tibble.\n\n![](https://r4va.netlify.app/chap27/img/image3.jpg){width=\"756\"}\n\n-   In the above the *.N()* function is used to gain access to the node data while manipulating the edge data. Similarly *.E()* will give you the edge data and *.G()* will give you the **tbl_graph** object itself.\n\n-   **`%>% mutate(Species = ifelse(leaf, as.character(iris$Species)[label], NA))`** - This line adds a new column called **`Species`** to the **`nodes`** data frame. The **`ifelse()`** function assigns a value to this column based on whether the node is a leaf or not. If it is a leaf, the value is taken from the **`label`** column of the **`iris$Species`** data frame (which contains the actual species names), and if it is not a leaf, the value is set to **`NA`**.\n\n-   **`%>% mutate(to_setose = .N()$Species[to] == 'setosa')`** - This line adds a new column called **`to_setose`** to the **`edges`** data frame. The **`ifelse()`** function assigns a value to this column based on whether the target node of each edge is a member of the **`setosa`** species or not. The **`to`** variable refers to the index of the target node in the **`nodes`** data frame, and the **`.N()`** function allows access to the **`Species`** column of the **`nodes`** data frame.\n\n### 27.4.3 Using `tbl_graph()` to build tidygraph data model.\n\nIn this section, I will use `tbl_graph()` of [**tidygraph**](https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/index.html)package to build an tidygraph's network graph data.frame.\n\nBefore typing the codes, review to reference guide of [`tbl_graph()`](https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/tbl_graph.html)\n\n::: callout-note\n## Required format of nodes and edges data\n\nGAStech_nodes has ID of nodes as first column. Label is optional?\n\nGAStech_edges_aggregated contains source and target as column 1 and 2.\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nGAStech_graph<- tbl_graph(nodes=GAStech_nodes,\n                          edges = GAStech_edges_aggregated,\n                          directed = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### 27.4.4 Reviewing the output tidygraph's graph object\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nGAStech_graph\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tbl_graph: 54 nodes and 1456 edges\n#\n# A directed multigraph with 1 component\n#\n# A tibble: 54 × 4\n     id label               Department     Title                                \n  <dbl> <chr>               <chr>          <chr>                                \n1     1 Mat.Bramar          Administration Assistant to CEO                     \n2     2 Anda.Ribera         Administration Assistant to CFO                     \n3     3 Rachel.Pantanal     Administration Assistant to CIO                     \n4     4 Linda.Lagos         Administration Assistant to COO                     \n5     5 Ruscella.Mies.Haber Administration Assistant to Engineering Group Manag…\n6     6 Carla.Forluniau     Administration Assistant to IT Group Manager        \n# ℹ 48 more rows\n#\n# A tibble: 1,456 × 4\n   from    to Weekday   Weight\n  <int> <int> <ord>      <int>\n1     1     2 Monday         4\n2     1     2 Tuesday        3\n3     1     2 Wednesday      5\n# ℹ 1,453 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   The output above reveals that *GAStech_graph* is a tbl_graph object with 54 nodes and 4541 edges.\n\n-   The command also prints the first six rows of \"Node Data\" and the first three of \"Edge Data\".\n\n-   It states that the Node Data is **active (Node data is on top of Edge data)**. The notion of an active tibble within a tbl_graph object makes it possible to manipulate the data in one tibble at a time.\n\n### 27.4.6 Changing the active object\n\nThe nodes tibble data frame is activated by default, but you can change which tibble data frame is active with the *activate()* function. Thus, if we wanted to rearrange the rows in the edges tibble to list those with the highest \"weight\" first, we could use *activate()* and then *arrange()*.\n\nFor example,\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nGAStech_graph %>% \n  activate(edges) %>% \n  arrange(desc(Weight))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tbl_graph: 54 nodes and 1456 edges\n#\n# A directed multigraph with 1 component\n#\n# A tibble: 1,456 × 4\n   from    to Weekday Weight\n  <int> <int> <ord>    <int>\n1    40    41 Tuesday     23\n2    40    43 Tuesday     19\n3    41    43 Tuesday     15\n4    41    40 Tuesday     14\n5    42    41 Tuesday     13\n6    42    40 Tuesday     12\n# ℹ 1,450 more rows\n#\n# A tibble: 54 × 4\n     id label           Department     Title           \n  <dbl> <chr>           <chr>          <chr>           \n1     1 Mat.Bramar      Administration Assistant to CEO\n2     2 Anda.Ribera     Administration Assistant to CFO\n3     3 Rachel.Pantanal Administration Assistant to CIO\n# ℹ 51 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nVisit the reference guide of [*activate()*](https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/activate.html) to find out more about the function.\n\n## 27.5 Plotting Static Network Graphs with **ggraph** package\n\n[**ggraph**](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/) is an extension of **ggplot2**, making it easier to carry over basic ggplot skills to the design of network graphs.\n\nAs in all network graph, there are three main aspects to a **ggraph**'s network graph, they are:\n\n-   [nodes](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggraph/vignettes/Nodes.html),\n\n-   [edges](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggraph/vignettes/Edges.html) and\n\n-   [layouts](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggraph/vignettes/Layouts.html).\n\nFor a comprehensive discussion of each of this aspect of graph, please refer to their respective vignettes provided.\n\n### 27.5.1 Plotting a basic network graph\n\nThe code chunk below uses\n\n-   [*ggraph()*](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/ggraph.html),\n\n-   [*geom-edge_link()*](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/geom_edge_link.html) and\n\n-   [*geom_node_point()*](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/geom_node_point.html) to plot a network graph by using *GAStech_graph*.\n\nBefore getting started, it is advisable to read their respective reference guide at least once.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggraph(GAStech_graph) +  #<<< GAStech_graph is a tbl_graph object\n  geom_edge_link() +\n  geom_node_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex08_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-note\n## Things to learn from code chunk above\n\n-   The basic plotting function is `ggraph()`, which takes the data to be used for the graph and the type of layout desired. Both of the arguments for `ggraph()` are built around *igraph*. Therefore, `ggraph()` canaccept either an *igraph* object or a *tbl_graph* object.\n\n-   **`igraph`** uses an adjacency matrix or an edge list and is more focused on traditional graph theory algorithms and operations.\n\n    In an edge list, each row represents an edge, with the first two columns containing the indices of the nodes that the edge connects.\n\n-   **`tidygraph`** uses a **`tbl_graph`** object, which is a tidy data frame representation of a graph. The **`nodes`** and **`edges`** data frames contain the metadata about the nodes and edges, respectively, and can be manipulated using the **`dplyr`** syntax\n:::\n\n### 27.5.2 Changing the default network graph theme\n\nIn this section, use [*theme_graph()*](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/theme_graph.html) to remove the x and y axes.

In visualising network data, this technique can be used to reduce edge over-plotting in a very meaning way by spreading nodes and edges out based on their attributes.

There are four well-known centrality measures, namely: degree, betweenness, closeness and eigenvector. It is beyond the scope of this hands-on exercise to cover the principles and mathematics of these measure here. Students are encouraged to refer to *Chapter 7: Actor Prominence* of **A User's Guide to Network Analysis in R** to gain better understanding of theses network measures.\n\n[Tidygraph documentation](https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/index.html) : so far we used `tbl_graph()` to create a tbl_graph network object / dataframe called GAStech_graph. Then we practise activate() to swtich between nodes and edges tibbles. This network obj is passed into ggraph() to plot the charts.\n\nNow we are using tidy graph to perform centrality calculations.\n\n[ggraph documentation](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/index.html)\n\n\n::: {.cell fig.asp='0.618'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ng <- GAStech_graph %>% \n  mutate(betweenness_centrality = centrality_betweenness()) %>% #<< tidygraph doc\n  ggraph(layout='fr') +\n  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight,\n                     alpha= 0.2)) + \n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) + \n  geom_node_point(aes(colour=Department, size = betweenness_centrality))\n\ng + theme_graph()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex08_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-note\n## Things to learn from the code above\n\n-   *mutate()* of **dplyr** is used to perform the computation and create a new col called betweenness_centrality.
