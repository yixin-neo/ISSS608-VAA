For all statistical tests reported in the plots, the default template abides by the [APA](https://my.ilstu.edu/~jhkahn/apastats.html) gold standard for statistical reporting. For example, here are results from a robust t-test:\n\n![](https://r4va.netlify.app/chap09/img/image2.jpg)\n\n::: callout-note\n-   parameter refers to the degree of freedom\n\n-   An effect size of 0.77 is a standardized measure of the magnitude of a treatment or intervention effect, or the strength of an association between two variables. Guideline is that an effect size of 0.2 is considered small, 0.5 is considered moderate, and 0.8 is considered large.\n\n-   CI of 95% means if we replicate our sampling from underlying distribution many times, 95% of our samples will have their means within this interval.\n:::\n\n## 9.3 Getting Started\n\n### 9.3.1 Installing and launching R packages\n\nIn this exercise, **ggstatsplot** and **tidyverse** will be used.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(ggstatsplot, tidyverse,nortest)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### 9.3.2 Importing data\n\nLets import the Exam_data.csv using the read_xls() function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nexam <- read_csv('data/Exam_data.csv')\n```\n:::\n\n\nTake a glimpse at the data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nexam\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 322 × 7\n   ID         CLASS GENDER RACE    ENGLISH MATHS SCIENCE\n   <chr>      <chr> <chr>  <chr>     <dbl> <dbl>   <dbl>\n 1 Student321 3I    Male   Malay        21     9      15\n 2 Student305 3I    Female Malay        24    22      16\n 3 Student289 3H    Male   Chinese      26    16      16\n 4 Student227 3F    Male   Chinese      27    77      31\n 5 Student318 3I    Male   Malay        27    11      25\n 6 Student306 3I    Female Malay        31    16      16\n 7 Student313 3I    Male   Chinese      31    21      25\n 8 Student316 3I    Male   Malay        31    18      27\n 9 Student312 3I    Male   Malay        33    19      15\n10 Student297 3H    Male   Indian       34    49      37\n# ℹ 312 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglimpse(exam)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRows: 322\nColumns: 7\n$ ID      <chr> \"Student321\", \"Student305\", \"Student289\", \"Student227\", \"Stude…\n$ CLASS   <chr> \"3I\", \"3I\", \"3H\", \"3F\", \"3I\", \"3I\", \"3I\", \"3I\", \"3I\", \"3H\", \"3…\n$ GENDER  <chr> \"Male\", \"Female\", \"Male\", \"Male\", \"Male\", \"Female\", \"Male\", \"M…\n$ RACE    <chr> \"Malay\", \"Malay\", \"Chinese\", \"Chinese\", \"Malay\", \"Malay\", \"Chi…\n$ ENGLISH <dbl> 21, 24, 26, 27, 27, 31, 31, 31, 33, 34, 34, 36, 36, 36, 37, 38…\n$ MATHS   <dbl> 9, 22, 16, 77, 11, 16, 21, 18, 19, 49, 39, 35, 23, 36, 49, 30,…\n$ SCIENCE <dbl> 15, 16, 16, 31, 25, 16, 25, 27, 15, 37, 42, 22, 32, 36, 35, 45…\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### 9.3.3 One-sample test: *gghistostats()* method\n\nIn the code chunk below, [*gghistostats()*](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/reference/gghistostats.html) is used to to build an visual of one-sample test on English scores.\n\n-   A one-sample test is a statistical hypothesis test used to determine whether the mean of a single sample of data differs significantly from a known or hypothesized value.\n\n-   It is a statistical test that compares the mean of a sample to a specified value, such as a population mean, to see if there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the sample comes from a population with the specified mean.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(1234)\n\ngghistostats(data=exam,\n             x = ENGLISH,\n             type='bayes',\n             test.value =60,\n             xlab = 'English scores')\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex05_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### 9.3.4 Unpacking the Bayes Factor\n\n-   A Bayes factor is the ratio of the likelihood of one particular hypothesis to the likelihood of another. It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories.\n\n-   That\\'s because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.\n\n-   When we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10. It can be defined mathematically as\n\n![](https://r4va.netlify.app/chap09/img/image5.jpg){width=\"335\"}\n\n-   The [**Schwarz criterion**](https://www.statisticshowto.com/bayesian-information-criterion/) is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough approximation of the Bayes Factor.\n\n### 9.3.5 How to interpret Bayes Factor\n\nA **Bayes Factor** can be any positive number. One of the most common interpretations is this one---first proposed by Harold Jeffereys (1961) and slightly modified by [Lee and Wagenmakers](https://www-tandfonline-com.libproxy.smu.edu.sg/doi/pdf/10.1080/00031305.1999.10474443?needAccess=true) in 2013:\n\n![](https://r4va.netlify.app/chap09/img/image6.jpg){width=\"342\"}\n\n#### 9.3.5.1 How to perform a one-sample wilcoxon test \n\nThe one-sample Wilcoxon test (non parametric) will tell us whether the scores are *significantly* different from 60 or not (and thus whether they are different from 60in the population or not)\n\nH0: EL scores = 60\n\nH1: EL scores != 60\n\nThe scores are assumed to be independent (a student\\'s score is not impacted or influenced by the score of another student)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwilcox.test(exam$ENGLISH,\n            mu = 60)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\n\tWilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction\n\ndata:  exam$ENGLISH\nV = 38743, p-value = 3.435e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true location is not equal to 60\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Interpretation**\n\nP-value\\<0.05, we have enough statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the EL scores are significantly different from 60.\n\n::: callout-note\n\nBy default, it is a two-tailed test that is done. As for the t.test() function, we can specify that a one-sided test is required by using either the alternative = \"greater\" or alternative = \"less argument in the wilcox.test() function.\n:::\n\n**Combine statistical test and plot**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(1234)\n\ngghistostats(data=exam,\n             x = ENGLISH,\n             type='nonparametric', #nonparametric = Wilcoxon, parametric = t-test\n             test.value =60,\n             xlab = 'English scores')\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex05_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nDid we forget to check if English scores follow a normal distribution? Use ad.test from nortest library.\n\nH0: EL scores follows normal distribution\n\nH1: EL scores do not follow normal distribution.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nad.test(exam$ENGLISH)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\n\tAnderson-Darling normality test\n\ndata:  exam$ENGLISH\nA = 4.3661, p-value = 7.341e-11\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nResults from the Anderson_darling normality test shows enough statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the EL scores do not follow normal distribution . Thus the use of non parametric test is correct.\n",
