    "text": "1.4 Grammar of Graphics\nBefore we getting started using ggplot2, it is important for us to understand the principles of Grammer of Graphics.\nGrammar of Graphics is a general scheme for data visualization which breaks up graphs into semantic components such as scales and layers. It was introduced by Leland Wilkinson (1999) Grammar of Graphics, Springer. The grammar of graphics is an answer to a question:\nWhat is a statistical graphic?\nIn the nutshell, Grammar of Graphics defines the rules of structuring mathematical and aesthetic elements into a meaningful graph.\nThere are two principles in Grammar of Graphics, they are:\n\nGraphics = distinct layers of grammatical elements\nMeaningful plots through aesthetic mapping\n\nA good grammar of graphics will allow us to gain insight into the composition of complicated graphics, and reveal unexpected connections between seemingly different graphics (Cox 1978). It also provides a strong foundation for understanding a diverse range of graphics. Furthermore, it may also help guide us on what a well-formed or correct graphic looks like, but there will still be many grammatically correct but nonsensical graphics.\n\n1.4.1 A Layered Grammar of Graphics\nggplot2 is an implementation of Leland Wilkinson’s Grammar of Graphics. “A layered grammar of graphics.”\nA short description of each building block are as follows:\n\nData: The dataset being plotted.\nAesthetics: Take attributes of the data and use them to influence visual characteristics, such as position, colours, size, shape, or transparency.\nGeometrics: The visual elements used for our data, such as point, bar or line. Facets split the data into subsets to create multiple variations of the same graph (paneling, multiple plots).\nStatistics: Statiscal transformations that summarise data (e.g. mean, confidence intervals).\nCoordinate systems define the plane on which data are mapped on the graphic.\nThemes modify all non-data components of a plot, such as main title, sub-title, y-aixs title, or legend background."

Four of them are categorical data type and the other three are in continuous data type.\n\nThe categorical attributes are: ID, CLASS, GENDER and RACE.\nThe continuous attributes are: MATHS, ENGLISH and SCIENCE.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the challenge in plotting statistical graph is annotation, especially with large number of data points.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data,\n       aes(y=ENGLISH, x=MATHS)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  geom_label(aes(label=ID))\n\n\n\n\nggrepel  is an extension of ggplot2 package which provides geoms for ggplot2 to repel overlapping text as in our examples on the right.\n\nWe simply replace geom_text() by geom_text_repel() and geom_label() by geom_label_repel.\n\n\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              size=0.5) +  \n  geom_label_repel(aes(label = ID), \n                   fontface = \"bold\", max.overlaps = 15) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot2 comes with eight built-in themes, they are: theme_gray(), theme_bw(), theme_classic(), theme_dark(), theme_light(), theme_linedraw(), theme_minimal(), and theme_void().\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth=5, \n                 color= 'black',\n                 fill='grey90') +\n  theme_gray() +\n  theme(panel.background=element_rect(fill='grey96')) +\n  ggtitle('Distribution of Math scores')\n\n\n\n\nRefer to this link to learn more about ggplot2 Themes\n\n\nggthemes provides ‘ggplot2’ themes that replicate the look of plots by Edward Tufte, Stephen Few, Fivethirtyeight, The Economist, ‘Stata’, ‘Excel’, and The Wall Street Journal, among others.\nIn the example below, The Economist theme is used.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth=5,\n                 boundary=100,\n                 color='grey25',\n                 fill='grey90',size=0.8) +\n  theme_economist() +\n  labs(y= 'No. of \\nPupils') +\n  theme(axis.title.y=element_text(angle = 0,\n                                  vjust=0.9)) +\n  ggtitle('Distribution of Math scores')\n\n\n\n\nIt also provides some extra geoms and scales for ‘ggplot2’. Consult this vignette to learn more.\n\n\n\nhrbrthemes package provides a base theme that focuses on typographic elements, including where various labels are placed as well as the fonts that are used.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth=5,\n                 boundary=100,\n                 color='grey25',\n                 fill='grey90') +\n  theme_ipsum() +\n  labs(y= 'No. of \\nPupils') +\n  theme(axis.title.y=element_text(angle = 0,\n                                  vjust=0.9)) +\n  ggtitle('Distribution of Math scores')\n\n\n\n\nThe second goal centers around productivity for a production workflow. In fact, this “production workflow” is the context for where the elements of hrbrthemes should be used.

There are several ggplot2 extensions provide functions to compose figure with multiple graphs. In this section, I will create composite plot by combining multiple graphs. First, create three statistical graphics by using the code chunk below.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np1 <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth=5,\n                 boundary=100,\n                 color='grey25',\n                 fill='grey90') +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100)) +\n  theme_ipsum(axis_title_size = 10,\n              base_size=10,\n              grid= 'Y') +\n labs(y= 'No. of \\nPupils') +\n theme(axis.title.y=element_text(angle = 0,\n                                  vjust=0.9),\n       plot.title=element_text(size =10)) +\n  ggtitle('Distribution of Math scores')\n\n\n\n\nNext\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np2 <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth=5,\n                 boundary=100,\n                 color='grey25',\n                 fill='grey90') +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100)) +\n  theme_ipsum(axis_title_size = 10,\n              base_size=10,\n              grid= 'Y') +\n labs(y= 'No. of \\nPupils') +\n theme(axis.title.y=element_text(angle = 0,\n                                  vjust=0.9),\n       plot.title=element_text(size =10)) +\n  ggtitle('Distribution of English scores')\n\n\n\n\nLastly, draw a scatterplot for English score versus Maths score by as shown below\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np3 <-ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              size = 0.5 )+\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100)) +\n  theme_ipsum(axis_title_size = 10,\n              base_size=10) +\n labs(y= 'EL score', x= 'Math score') +\n theme(axis.title.y=element_text(angle = 0,\n                                  vjust=0.9),\n       plot.title=element_text(size =10)) +\n  ggtitle('English scores vesus Math scores \\nfor Primary 3')\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are several ggplot2 extension’s functions support the needs to prepare composite figure by combining several graphs such as grid.arrange() of gridExtra package and plot_grid() of cowplot package. In this section, I am going to shared with you an ggplot2 extension called patchwork which is specially designed for combining separate ggplot2 graphs into a single figure.\nPatchwork package has a very simple syntax where we can create layouts super easily. Here’s the general syntax that combines:\n\nTwo-Column Layout using the Plus Sign +.\nParenthesis () to create a subplot group.\nTwo-Row Layout using the Division Sign /\n\n\n\n\nFigure in the tabset below shows a composite of two histograms created using patchwork. Note how simple the syntax used to create the plot!\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np1 + p2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can plot more complex composite by using appropriate operators. For example, the composite figure below is plotted by using:\n\n“|” operator to stack two ggplot2 graphs,\n“/” operator to place the plots beside each other,\n“()” operator the define the sequence of the plotting.\n\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(p1 / p2) | p3\n\n\n\n\nOther interesting plot layouts\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n((p1 / p2) | p3) + grid:: textGrob('I can place \\nsome text here.',\n                                   hjust=0, \n                                   x=-0, \n                                   gp=grid::gpar(font=3, \n                                                 fontsize = 12))\n\n\n\n\nTo learn more about, refer to Plot Assembly.\n\n\n\nIn order to identify subplots in text, patchwork also provides auto-tagging capabilities as shown in the figure below.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n((p1 / p2) | p3) +\n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'I')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeside providing functions to place plots next to each other based on the provided layout.

    "text": "3.4 Interactive Data Visualisation - ggiraph methods\nggiraph  is an htmlwidget and a ggplot2 extension. It allows ggplot graphics to be interactive.\nInteractive is made with ggplot geometries that can understand three arguments:\n\nTooltip: a column of data-sets that contain tooltips to be displayed when the mouse is over elements.\nOnclick: a column of data-sets that contain a JavaScript function to be executed when elements are clicked.\nData_id: a column of data-sets that contain an id to be associated with elements.\n\nIf it used within a shiny application, elements associated with an id (data_id) can be selected and manipulated on client and server sides. Refer to this article for more detail explanation.\n\n3.4.1 Tooltip effect with tooltip aesthetic\nBelow shows a typical code chunk to plot an interactive statistical graph by using ggiraph package. Notice that the code chunk consists of two parts. First, an ggplot object will be created. Next, girafe() of ggiraph will be used to create an interactive svg object.\n\np <- ggplot(data=exam_data,\n            aes(x=MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(aes(tooltip=ID),\n                           stackgroups = TRUE,\n                           binwidth = 1,\n                           method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,\n                     breaks= NULL)  #null to suppress axis labels\n\ngirafe(ggobj=p,\n       width_svg = 6,\n       height_svg = 6*0.618)\n\nNotice that two steps are involved. First, an interactive version of ggplot2 geom (i.e. geom_dotplot_interactive()) will be used to create the basic graph. Then, girafe() will be used to generate an svg object to be displayed on an html page.\nNYX: steps in creating an interactive graphic 1. instead of geom_point (i.e.), use geom_point_interactive - provide at least one of the aesthetics tools (tooltip, data_id or onclick) 2. call function girafe with the ggplot object to translate graphic into a web interactive graphic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBy hovering the mouse pointer on an data point of interest, the student’s ID will be displayed. To set index as the tooltip, replace with row.names(exam_data). To set numeric values as tooltip, replace with factor(MATHS).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.2 Displaying multiple information on tooltip\nThe content of the tooltip can be customised by including a list object as shown in the code chunk below. We create a new column [tooltip] in exam_data by concatenating ID and Class info.\n\nexam_data$tooltip <- c(paste0(\"Name= \",\n                              exam_data$ID,\n                              \"\\n Class= \",\n                              exam_data$CLASS))\n\np <- ggplot(data=exam_data,\n            aes(x=MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(aes(tooltip=tooltip),\n                           stackgroups = TRUE,\n                           binwidth = 1,\n                           method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,\n                     breaks= NULL)  #null to suppress axis labels\n\ngirafe(ggobj=p,\n       width_svg = 8,\n       height_svg = 8*0.618)\n\nThe first three lines of codes in the code chunk create a new field called tooltip. At the same time, it populates text in ID and CLASS fields into the newly created field. Next, this newly created field is used as tooltip field as shown in the code of line 7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractivity\n\n\n\nBy hovering the mouse pointer on an data point of interest, the student's ID and Class will be displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.3 Customising Tooltip style\nCode chunk below uses opts_tooltip() of ggiraph to customize tooltip rendering by add css declarations.\n\ntooltip_css <- 'background-color:palegreen; font-style:bold; color:black;'  #<<<\n\nexam_data$tooltip <- c(paste0(\"Name= \",\n                              exam_data$ID,\n                              \"\\n Class= \",\n                              exam_data$CLASS))\n\np <- ggplot(data=exam_data,\n            aes(x=MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(aes(tooltip=tooltip),\n                           stackgroups = TRUE,\n                           binwidth = 1,\n                           method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,\n                     breaks= NULL)  #null to suppress axis labels\n\ngirafe(ggobj=p,\n       width_svg = 8,\n       height_svg = 8*0.618,\n       options = list(          #<<<\n         opts_tooltip(          #<<<\n           css=tooltip_css\n         )\n       ))\n\nNotice that the background colour of the tooltip is palegreen and the font colour is black and bold. For demonstration purposes, we can also make the font italic and change the font size.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRefer to Customizing girafe objects to learn more about how to customise ggiraph objects.\n\n\n\n3.4.4 Displaying statistics on tooltip\nCode chunk below shows an advanced way to customise tooltip. In this example, a function is used to compute 90% confident interval of the mean. The derived statistics are then displayed in the tooltip.\n\ntooltip <- function(y, ymax, accuracy = 0.01) {\n  mean <- scales::number(y, accuracy = accuracy)\n  sem <- scales:: number (ymax-y, accuracy = accuracy)\n  paste(\"mean maths scores:\" , mean, \"+/-\", sem)\n}\n\n\ngg_point <- ggplot(data=exam_data,\n                   aes(x = RACE)) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y=MATHS,\n                   tooltip = after_stat(tooltip(y, ymax))),\n               fun.data = mean_se,\n               geom = GeomInteractiveCol,\n               fill = 'lightblue') +\n  stat_summary(aes(y= MATHS),\n               fun.data = mean_se,\n               geom= 'errorbar',\n               width = 0.2,\n               size = 0.2)\n\ngirafe(ggobj=gg_point,\n       width_svg = 8,\n       height_svg = 8 * 0.618)\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATION of the codes above\n\nTooltip self defined function:\n\n\nIt takes in two arguments (y and ymax) from results of stat_summary() via after_stat(). accuracy is a fixed parameter and has a value of 0.01.\nscales:: number is to convert number to text, with formatting.\nsem output: If ymax = y + se , then in tooltip, sem = ymax-y, isnt sem = se?\nIt outputs \"mean maths scores: 57.44 +/- 2.03\"\n\n\nStat_summary function creates another geom layer. The first stat summary function has two aes mappings to visual: (1)MATHS as Y (2)tooltip output\n\n\nIt first applies mean_se method to output y, ymin, ymax for each X value (usually categorical)\nAfter this, these groups of 3 values are send into tooltip function via after_stat() helper function\nGeomInteractive makes the columns interactive so tooltips is displayed when users hover over\n\n\nThe second stat summary uses y,ymin, ymax obtained from method= mean_se to plot the error bar\n\nDOUCUMENTATION\nmean_se\nstat_summary(aes(fun.data=mean_se) is default. mean_se(x, mult = 1). When input a list of values, it returns a data frame with three columns:\ny: The mean.\nymin: The mean minus the multiples of the standard error.\nymax: The mean plus the multiples of the standard error.\nThere are a few summary functions from the Hmisc package which are reformatted for use in stat_summary(). They all return aesthetics for y, ymax, and ymin.\nmean_cl_normal() Returns sample mean and 95% confidence intervals assuming normality (i.e., t-distribution based)\nmean_sdl() Returns sample mean and a confidence interval based on the standard deviation times some constant\nmean_cl_boot() Uses a bootstrap method to determine a confidence interval for the sample mean without assuming normality.\nmedian_hilow() Returns the median and an upper and lower quantiles.\n\n\n3.4.5 Hover effect with data_id aesthetic\nCode chunk below shows the second interactive feature of ggiraph, namely data_id.\n\np <- ggplot(data= exam_data,\n            aes(x=MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(aes(data_id=CLASS),\n                           stackgroups = TRUE,\n                           binwidth= 1,\n                           method = 'histodot') +\n  scale_y_continuous( NULL,\n                      breaks = NULL)\n\ngirafe(ggobj=p,\n       width_svg = 8,\n       height_svg = 8 *0.618)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\n\nInteractivity: Elements associated with a data_id (i.e CLASS) will be highlighted upon mouse over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the default value of the hover css is hover_css = \"fill:orange;\".\n\n\n3.4.6 Styling hover effect\nIn the code chunk below, css codes are used to change the highlighting effect.\n\np <- ggplot(data=exam_data,\n            aes(x=MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(aes(data_id = CLASS),\n                           stackgroups = TRUE,\n                           binwidth = 1,\n                           method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,\n                     breaks= NULL)  #null to suppress axis labels\n\ngirafe(ggobj=p,\n       width_svg = 6,\n       height_svg = 6*0.618,\n       options = list(                          #<<<\n         opts_hover(css='fill: #202020;'),      #<<<\n         opts_hover_inv(css = 'opacity: 0.2;')  #<<<\n         )\n       )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\n\nInteractivity: Elements associated with a data_id (i.e CLASS) will be highlighted upon mouse over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Different from previous example (tooltip_css is pre-defined as input to a parameter in girafe(options=list(opts_tooltip(css=tooltip_css)))), in this example the ccs customisation request are encoded directly as girafe(options=list(opts_hover(css='tooltip_css'fill:#202020;')))\n\n\n3.4.7 Combining tooltip and hover effect\nThere are time that we want to combine tooltip and hover effect on the interactive statistical graph as shown in the code chunk below.\n\np <- ggplot(data=exam_data,\n            aes(x=MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(aes(tooltip = CLASS,  #<<<\n                               data_id = CLASS),  #<<<\n                           stackgroups = TRUE,\n                           binwidth = 1,\n                           method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,\n                     breaks= NULL)  #null to suppress axis labels\n\ngirafe(ggobj=p,\n       width_svg = 6,\n       height_svg = 6*0.618,\n       options = list(                          #<<<\n         opts_hover(css='fill: blue;'),      #<<<\n         opts_hover_inv(css = 'opacity: 0.2;')  #<<<\n         )\n       )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\n\nInteractivity: Elements associated with a data_id (i.e CLASS) will be highlighted upon mouse over.

    "text": "When telling a visually-driven data story, animated graphics tends to attract the interest of the audience and make deeper impression than static graphics. In this hands-on exercise, I will learn how to create animated data visualisation by using gganimate and plotly r packages. At the same time, I will also learn how to\n(i) reshape data by using tidyr package, and\n(ii) process, wrangle and transform data by using dplyr package.\n\n\nWhen creating animations, the plot does not actually move. Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames, just like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot when conveying motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregate data. The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.\n\n\n\n\nBefore we dive into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it’s important to understand some of the key concepts and terminology related to this type of visualization.\n\nFrame: In an animated line graph, each frame represents a different point in time or a different category. When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.\nAnimation Attributes: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves. For example, you can specify the duration of each frame, the easing function used to transition between frames, and whether to start the animation from the current frame or from the beginning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBeforewe start making animated graphs, we should first ask ourself: Does it makes sense to go through the effort? If we are conducting an exploratory data analysis, a animated graphic may not be worth the time investment. However, if we are giving a presentation, a few well-placed animated graphics can help an audience connect with our topic remarkably better than static counterparts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will use p_load from pacman package to check, install and load the following R packages:\n\nplotly, R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs.\ngganimate, an ggplot extension for creating animated statistical graphs.\ngifski converts video frames to GIF animations using pngquant’s fancy features for efficient cross-frame palettes and temporal dithering. It produces animated GIFs that use thousands of colors per frame.\ngapminder: An excerpt of the data available at Gapminder.org. We just want to use its country_colors scheme.\ntidyverse, a family of modern R packages specially designed to support data science, analysis and communication task including creating static statistical graphs.\n\n\npacman::p_load(readxl, gifski, gapminder, plotly, gganimate, tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, the Data worksheet from GlobalPopulation Excel workbook will be used.\nWrite a code chunk to import Data worksheet from GlobalPopulation Excel workbook by using appropriate R package from tidyverse family.\n\ncol <- c('Country', 'Continent')\n\nglobalPop <- read_xls('data/GlobalPopulation.xls',\n                      sheet='Data') %>% \n  mutate_each_(funs(factor(.)), col) %>%\n  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))\n\n\nglimpse(globalPop)\n\nRows: 6,204\nColumns: 6\n$ Country    <fct> \"Afghanistan\", \"Afghanistan\", \"Afghanistan\", \"Afghanistan\",…\n$ Year       <int> 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014,…\n$ Young      <dbl> 83.6, 84.1, 84.6, 85.1, 84.5, 84.3, 84.1, 83.7, 82.9, 82.1,…\n$ Old        <dbl> 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.6, 4.6, 4.6, 4.6, 4.7, 4.7, 4.7,…\n$ Population <dbl> 21559.9, 22912.8, 23898.2, 25268.4, 28513.7, 31057.0, 32738…\n$ Continent  <fct> Asia, Asia, Asia, Asia, Asia, Asia, Asia, Asia, Asia, Asia,…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code\n\n\n\n\nread_xls() of readxl package is used to import the Excel worksheet.\nmutate_each_() of dplyr package is used to convert all character data type into factor.\n\nThis line applies the factor() function to each column specified in the col argument.

    "text": "4.1 Overview\nWhen telling a visually-driven data story, animated graphics tends to attract the interest of the audience and make deeper impression than static graphics. In this hands-on exercise, I will learn how to create animated data visualisation by using gganimate and plotly r packages. At the same time, I will also learn how to\n(i) reshape data by using tidyr package, and\n(ii) process, wrangle and transform data by using dplyr package.\n\n4.1.1 Basic concepts of animation\nWhen creating animations, the plot does not actually move. Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames, just like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot when conveying motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregate data. The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Terminology\nBefore we dive into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it’s important to understand some of the key concepts and terminology related to this type of visualization.\n\nFrame: In an animated line graph, each frame represents a different point in time or a different category. When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.\nAnimation Attributes: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves. For example, you can specify the duration of each frame, the easing function used to transition between frames, and whether to start the animation from the current frame or from the beginning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBeforewe start making animated graphs, we should first ask ourself: Does it makes sense to go through the effort? If we are conducting an exploratory data analysis, a animated graphic may not be worth the time investment. However, if we are giving a presentation, a few well-placed animated graphics can help an audience connect with our topic remarkably better than static counterparts."
