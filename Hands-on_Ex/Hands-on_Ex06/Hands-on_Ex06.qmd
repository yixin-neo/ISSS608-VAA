# 10Â  Visualising Uncertainty

## 10.1 Learning Outcome

## 10.2 Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates (Manual Method, without ggdist package)

-   A point estimate is a single number, such as a mean.

Uncertainty is expressed as standard error, confidence interval, or credible interval

::: callout-important
Don't confuse the uncertainty of a point estimate (mean, median..) with the variation in the sample (standard deviation sigma, and variation sigma square etc).

The standard deviation measures the variation of the values from the mean of ONE sample.

The standard error is the standard deviation of both sides of the 'mother of all means' of all the sample means. \<- refer lecture 4 slide 23

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, plotly, crosstalk, DT, ggdist, gganimate, ggiraph)
```

-   [**DT**](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/) provides an R interface to the JavaScript library [DataTables](https://datatables.net/) that create interactive table on html page.

-   [Crosstalk](https://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/) is an add-on to the htmlwidgets package. It extends htmlwidgets with a set of classes, functions, and conventions for implementing cross-widget interactions (currently, linked brushing and filtering).

-   [ggdist](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/) is an R package that provides a flexible set of `ggplot2` geoms and stats designed especially for **visualizing** distributions and uncertainty.

    Lets load the student exam data.csv

```{r}
exam <- read_csv('C:/yixin-neo/ISSS608-VAA/Hands-on_Ex/Hands-on_Ex05/data/Exam_data.csv')
```

### 10.2.1 Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates: Manual calculation and creating of my_sum table

The code chunk below performs the followings:

-   group the observation by RACE,

-   computes the count of observations, mean, standard deviation and standard error of Maths by RACE, and

-   save the output as a tibble data table called `my_sum`.

    ```{r}
    my_sum <- exam %>% 
      group_by(RACE) %>% 
      summarise(n=n(),
                mean=mean(MATHS),
                sd = sd(MATHS)) %>% 
      mutate(se=sd/sqrt(n-1))   #<<< standard error formula
    ```

Refer to lecture 4 slide 20 for mathematical formula explanation.

my_sum is specially created for visualisation later using ggplot2.

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(my_sum), format = 'html')
```

### 10.2.2 Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates: Use my_sum table and ggplot2 methods to plot uncertainty

The code chunk below is used to reveal the **standard error** of **mean** maths score by race. It shows **one** standard deviation away from the 'mother of all means' for all the means from all the samples.

::: callout-note
Standard error is a measure of the variation of the mean of all the means from all samples of an underlying distribution.
:::

```{r}
ggplot(my_sum) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(x=RACE,
                    ymin=mean-se,
                    ymax=mean+se),
                width = 0.2,
                colour = 'black',
                alpha = 0.9,
                size=0.5) +
    geom_point(aes(x=RACE,
                 y=mean),
             stat = 'identity', #<<< actual points refer to mean 
             color='red', 
             size = 1.5,
             alpha = 1) + 
  ggtitle('Standard error of mean maths score by race')
```

::: callout-note
In the code above, **`stat = 'identity'`** means that the **`y`** values in the **`geom_point`** layer correspond to the **actual values** in the data frame, rather than a summary statistic like mean or median.
:::

### 10.2.3 Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates: **ggplot2** methods

Lets plot a 95% confidence interval of mean maths score by race. The error bars should be sorted by the average maths scores. (Refer to take-home ex 1 on sorting by mean)

```{r}
ggplot(my_sum) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(x=reorder(RACE,-mean),  # reorder(x,y) means to reorder x based on increasing or decreasing values of y. To sort by descending values of Y, use -Y.
                    ymin=mean-1.96*se,    #<<<< formula to calc 95% CI
                    ymax=mean+ 1.96*se),  #<<<<
                width = 0.2,
                colour = 'black',
                alpha = 0.9,
                size=0.5) +
    geom_point(aes(x=RACE,
                 y=mean),
             stat = 'identity', #<<< actual points refer to mean 
             color='red', 
             size = 1.5,
             alpha = 1) + 
  ggtitle('95% confidence interval of maths score by race')
```

::: callout-note
**What is the difference between standard error plot above and this 95% confidence interval plot?**

Earlier , we plot error bars of 1 standard deviation away from the mother of all means.

Here, we are plotting 1.96 \* standard deviation away from the mother of all means. The higher the % CI, the greater the margin or error.
:::

### 10.2.4 Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates with interactive error bars

**Task: Plot an interactive error bars for the 99% confidence interval of mean maths score by race.**

Recall in hands-on 3 that we create can create interactive plots using [ggiraph](https://davidgohel.github.io/ggiraph/) and [ggplot geometries](https://davidgohel.github.io/ggiraph/reference/#section-interactive-geometries) that can understand 3 arguments; namely **tooltip**, **data_id** and **onclick**.
I will use one of them methods (geom_errorbar_interactive with girafe) to construct here. The other method is to use plotly.

```{r}
# create a new column tooltip to contain the tooltip text.
my_sum$tooltip <- c(paste0("RACE: ",
                           my_sum$RACE,
                           "\n N= ",
                            my_sum$n,
                           "\n Ave Score: ",
                           round(my_sum$mean, digits=2)
                           ))

p <- ggplot(my_sum) +
  geom_errorbar_interactive(aes(x=reorder(RACE,-mean),
                    ymin=mean-2.58*se,    #<<<< formula to calc 95% CI
                    ymax=mean+ 2.58*se,
                    tooltip=tooltip),  
                width = 0.2,
                colour = 'black',
                alpha = 0.9,
                size=0.5) +
    geom_point(aes(x=RACE,
                 y=mean),
             stat = 'identity', #<<< actual points refer to mean 
             color='red', 
             size = 1.5,
             alpha = 1) + 
  labs(title='99% confidence interval of maths score by race',
       x = 'Race') +
  theme(axis.title.y=element_text(angle = 0,
                                  vjust=0.9),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
        axis.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
        axis.line = element_line(size = 0.2))

girafe(ggobj = p,
       width_svg = 8,
       height_svg = 8*0.618)
```

**Next task: Create an interactive Data Table beside the interactive error bars (also with coordinated views)**

First, we create an interactive Data Table using DT().
 - We use the **`%>%`** operator to pipe the data frame into the **`mutate_if()`** function, where we specify the condition **`is.numeric`** to select only the numeric columns. We use the tilde **`~`** symbol to specify the rounding function, and pass the **`digits`** argument to round to two decimal places. The resulting data frame **`df`** will have all numerical columns rounded to two decimal places.

```{r}
# Round all numerical columns to two decimal places
my_sum <- my_sum %>% 
  mutate_if(is.numeric, ~ round(., digits = 2))

DT::datatable(my_sum, class='compact')
```

Next, combine uncertainty graph and **plotly** interactive table using [Crosstalk](https://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/), which is an add-on to the htmlwidgets package. It extends htmlwidgets with a set of classes, functions, and conventions for implementing cross-widget interactions (currently, linked brushing and filtering).

(refer to hands-on 3)

The datatable is linked to the visualisation on the left. Click on multiple rows to filter according.

```{r}
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 6
#| code-fold: True

# Use highlight_key() to add a unique key to the data frame my_sum3 so that it can be linked to interactive plots later
d <- highlight_key(my_sum) 


p <- ggplot(d) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(x=reorder(RACE,-mean),
                    ymin=mean-2.58*se,    #<<<< formula to calc 95% CI
                    ymax=mean+ 2.58*se),  
                width = 0.2,
                colour = 'black',
                alpha = 0.9,
                size=0.5) +
    geom_point(aes(x=RACE,
                 y=mean),
             stat = 'identity', #<<< actual points refer to mean 
             color='red', 
             size = 1.5,
             alpha = 1) + 
  labs(title='99% confidence interval of maths score by race',
       x = 'Race') +
  theme(axis.title.y=element_text(angle = 0,
                                  vjust=0.9),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
        axis.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
        axis.line = element_line(size = 0.2))

# Convert ggplot to an interactive plotly plot using the ggplotly(), "plotly click" specifies that highlight should be based on click
gg <- highlight(ggplotly(p),        
                "plotly_selected")  

crosstalk::bscols(list(width = 7,gg),
                  list(width=5,DT::datatable(d)),
                  widths=5)
```

My mistakes on the attempt to produce this plot:

1.  Did not use d in ggplot(d) and datatable(d) in crosstalk. As a result, the plot and table were both not able to communicate with each other.
2.  Wrongly added `geom_errorbar_interactive(aes(tooltip)` and `girafe` together with `plotly` and `crosstalk::bscols`. As as result, no error bars were seen.

## 10.3 Visualising Uncertainty: **ggdist** package

-   [**ggdist**](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/) is an R package that provides a flexible set of ggplot2 geoms and stats designed especially for visualising distributions and uncertainty.

-   It is designed for both frequentist and Bayesian uncertainty visualization, taking the view that uncertainty visualization can be unified through the perspective of distribution visualization:

    -   for frequentist models, one visualises confidence distributions or bootstrap distributions (see vignette(\"freq-uncertainty-vis\"));

    -   for Bayesian models, one visualises probability distributions (see the tidybayes package, which builds on top of ggdist).

### 10.3.1 Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates: **ggdist** methods

In the code chunk below, [`stat_pointinterval()`](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/reference/stat_pointinterval.html) of **ggdist** is used to build a visual for displaying distribution of maths scores by race.
