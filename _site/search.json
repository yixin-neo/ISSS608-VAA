    "text": "1.4 Grammar of Graphics\nBefore we getting started using ggplot2, it is important for us to understand the principles of Grammer of Graphics.\nGrammar of Graphics is a general scheme for data visualization which breaks up graphs into semantic components such as scales and layers. It was introduced by Leland Wilkinson (1999) Grammar of Graphics, Springer. The grammar of graphics is an answer to a question:\nWhat is a statistical graphic?\nIn the nutshell, Grammar of Graphics defines the rules of structuring mathematical and aesthetic elements into a meaningful graph.\nThere are two principles in Grammar of Graphics, they are:\n\nGraphics = distinct layers of grammatical elements\nMeaningful plots through aesthetic mapping\n\nA good grammar of graphics will allow us to gain insight into the composition of complicated graphics, and reveal unexpected connections between seemingly different graphics (Cox 1978). It also provides a strong foundation for understanding a diverse range of graphics. Furthermore, it may also help guide us on what a well-formed or correct graphic looks like, but there will still be many grammatically correct but nonsensical graphics.\n\n1.4.1 A Layered Grammar of Graphics\nggplot2 is an implementation of Leland Wilkinson’s Grammar of Graphics. “A layered grammar of graphics.”\nA short description of each building block are as follows:\n\nData: The dataset being plotted.\nAesthetics: Take attributes of the data and use them to influence visual characteristics, such as position, colours, size, shape, or transparency.\nGeometrics: The visual elements used for our data, such as point, bar or line. Facets split the data into subsets to create multiple variations of the same graph (paneling, multiple plots).\nStatistics: Statiscal transformations that summarise data (e.g. mean, confidence intervals).\nCoordinate systems define the plane on which data are mapped on the graphic.\nThemes modify all non-data components of a plot, such as main title, sub-title, y-aixs title, or legend background."

It is in csv file format.\nThe code chunk below imports exam_data.csv into R environment by using read_csv() function of readr package. readr is one of the tidyverse package.\n\nexam_data <- read_csv('data/Exam_data.csv')\n\nThere are a total of seven attributes in the exam_data tibble data frame. Four of them are categorical data type and the other three are in continuous data type.\n\nThe categorical attributes are: ID, CLASS, GENDER and RACE.\nThe continuous attributes are: MATHS, ENGLISH and SCIENCE.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the challenge in plotting statistical graph is annotation, especially with large number of data points.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data,\n       aes(y=ENGLISH, x=MATHS)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  geom_label(aes(label=ID))\n\n\n\n\nggrepel  is an extension of ggplot2 package which provides geoms for ggplot2 to repel overlapping text as in our examples on the right.\n\nWe simply replace geom_text() by geom_text_repel() and geom_label() by geom_label_repel.\n\n\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              size=0.5) +  \n  geom_label_repel(aes(label = ID), \n                   fontface = \"bold\", max.overlaps = 15) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot2 comes with eight built-in themes, they are: theme_gray(), theme_bw(), theme_classic(), theme_dark(), theme_light(), theme_linedraw(), theme_minimal(), and theme_void().\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth=5, \n                 color= 'black',\n                 fill='grey90') +\n  theme_gray() +\n  theme(panel.background=element_rect(fill='grey96')) +\n  ggtitle('Distribution of Math scores')\n\n\n\n\nRefer to this link to learn more about ggplot2 Themes\n\n\nggthemes provides ‘ggplot2’ themes that replicate the look of plots by Edward Tufte, Stephen Few, Fivethirtyeight, The Economist, ‘Stata’, ‘Excel’, and The Wall Street Journal, among others.\nIn the example below, The Economist theme is used.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth=5,\n                 boundary=100,\n                 color='grey25',\n                 fill='grey90',size=0.8) +\n  theme_economist() +\n  labs(y= 'No. of \\nPupils') +\n  theme(axis.title.y=element_text(angle = 0,\n                                  vjust=0.9)) +\n  ggtitle('Distribution of Math scores')\n\n\n\n\nIt also provides some extra geoms and scales for ‘ggplot2’. Consult this vignette to learn more.\n\n\n\nhrbrthemes package provides a base theme that focuses on typographic elements, including where various labels are placed as well as the fonts that are used.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth=5,\n                 boundary=100,\n                 color='grey25',\n                 fill='grey90') +\n  theme_ipsum() +\n  labs(y= 'No. of \\nPupils') +\n  theme(axis.title.y=element_text(angle = 0,\n                                  vjust=0.9)) +\n  ggtitle('Distribution of Math scores')\n\n\n\n\nThe second goal centers around productivity for a production workflow. In fact, this “production workflow” is the context for where the elements of hrbrthemes should be used. Consult this vignette to learn more.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth=5,\n                 boundary=100,\n                 color='grey25',\n                 fill='grey90') +\n  theme_ipsum(axis_title_size = 15,\n              base_size=15,\n              grid= 'Y') +\n labs(y= 'No. of \\nPupils') +\n theme(axis.title.y=element_text(angle = 0,\n                                  vjust=0.9)) +\n  ggtitle('Distribution of Math scores')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat can we learn from the code chunk above?\n\n\n\n\naxis_title_size argument is used to increase the font size of the axis title to 18,\nbase_size argument is used to increase the default axis label to 15, and\ngrid argument is used to remove the x-axis grid lines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is not unusual that multiple graphs are required to tell a compelling visual story. There are several ggplot2 extensions provide functions to compose figure with multiple graphs. In this section, I will create composite plot by combining multiple graphs. First, create three statistical graphics by using the code chunk below.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np1 <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth=5,\n                 boundary=100,\n                 color='grey25',\n                 fill='grey90') +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100)) +\n  theme_ipsum(axis_title_size = 10,\n              base_size=10,\n              grid= 'Y') +\n labs(y= 'No. of \\nPupils') +\n theme(axis.title.y=element_text(angle = 0,\n                                  vjust=0.9),\n       plot.title=element_text(size =10)) +\n  ggtitle('Distribution of Math scores')\n\n\n\n\nNext\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np2 <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth=5,\n                 boundary=100,\n                 color='grey25',\n                 fill='grey90') +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100)) +\n  theme_ipsum(axis_title_size = 10,\n              base_size=10,\n              grid= 'Y') +\n labs(y= 'No. of \\nPupils') +\n theme(axis.title.y=element_text(angle = 0,\n                                  vjust=0.9),\n       plot.title=element_text(size =10)) +\n  ggtitle('Distribution of English scores')\n\n\n\n\nLastly, draw a scatterplot for English score versus Maths score by as shown below\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np3 <-ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              size = 0.5 )+\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100)) +\n  theme_ipsum(axis_title_size = 10,\n              base_size=10) +\n labs(y= 'EL score', x= 'Math score') +\n theme(axis.title.y=element_text(angle = 0,\n                                  vjust=0.9),\n       plot.title=element_text(size =10)) +\n  ggtitle('English scores vesus Math scores \\nfor Primary 3')\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are several ggplot2 extension’s functions support the needs to prepare composite figure by combining several graphs such as grid.arrange() of gridExtra package and plot_grid() of cowplot package. In this section, I am going to shared with you an ggplot2 extension called patchwork which is specially designed for combining separate ggplot2 graphs into a single figure.\nPatchwork package has a very simple syntax where we can create layouts super easily. Here’s the general syntax that combines:\n\nTwo-Column Layout using the Plus Sign +.\nParenthesis () to create a subplot group.\nTwo-Row Layout using the Division Sign /\n\n\n\n\nFigure in the tabset below shows a composite of two histograms created using patchwork. Note how simple the syntax used to create the plot!\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np1 + p2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can plot more complex composite by using appropriate operators. For example, the composite figure below is plotted by using:\n\n“|” operator to stack two ggplot2 graphs,\n“/” operator to place the plots beside each other,\n“()” operator the define the sequence of the plotting.\n\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(p1 / p2) | p3\n\n\n\n\nOther interesting plot layouts\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n((p1 / p2) | p3) + grid:: textGrob('I can place \\nsome text here.',\n                                   hjust=0, \n                                   x=-0, \n                                   gp=grid::gpar(font=3, \n                                                 fontsize = 12))\n\n\n\n\nTo learn more about, refer to Plot Assembly.\n\n\n\nIn order to identify subplots in text, patchwork also provides auto-tagging capabilities as shown in the figure below.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n((p1 / p2) | p3) +\n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'I')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeside providing functions to place plots next to each other based on the provided layout.

    "text": "3.4 Interactive Data Visualisation - ggiraph methods\nggiraph  is an htmlwidget and a ggplot2 extension. It allows ggplot graphics to be interactive.\nInteractive is made with ggplot geometries that can understand three arguments:\n\nTooltip: a column of data-sets that contain tooltips to be displayed when the mouse is over elements.\nOnclick: a column of data-sets that contain a JavaScript function to be executed when elements are clicked.\nData_id: a column of data-sets that contain an id to be associated with elements.\n\nIf it used within a shiny application, elements associated with an id (data_id) can be selected and manipulated on client and server sides. Refer to this article for more detail explanation.\n\n3.4.1 Tooltip effect with tooltip aesthetic\nBelow shows a typical code chunk to plot an interactive statistical graph by using ggiraph package. Notice that the code chunk consists of two parts. First, an ggplot object will be created. Next, girafe() of ggiraph will be used to create an interactive svg object.\n\np <- ggplot(data=exam_data,\n            aes(x=MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(aes(tooltip=ID),\n                           stackgroups = TRUE,\n                           binwidth = 1,\n                           method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,\n                     breaks= NULL)  #null to suppress axis labels\n\ngirafe(ggobj=p,\n       width_svg = 6,\n       height_svg = 6*0.618)\n\nNotice that two steps are involved. First, an interactive version of ggplot2 geom (i.e. geom_dotplot_interactive()) will be used to create the basic graph. Then, girafe() will be used to generate an svg object to be displayed on an html page.\nNYX: steps in creating an interactive graphic 1. instead of geom_point (i.e.), use geom_point_interactive - provide at least one of the aesthetics tools (tooltip, data_id or onclick) 2. call function girafe with the ggplot object to translate graphic into a web interactive graphic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBy hovering the mouse pointer on an data point of interest, the student’s ID will be displayed. To set index as the tooltip, replace with row.names(exam_data). To set numeric values as tooltip, replace with factor(MATHS).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.2 Displaying multiple information on tooltip\nThe content of the tooltip can be customised by including a list object as shown in the code chunk below. We create a new column [tooltip] in exam_data by concatenating ID and Class info.\n\nexam_data$tooltip <- c(paste0(\"Name= \",\n                              exam_data$ID,\n                              \"\\n Class= \",\n                              exam_data$CLASS))\n\np <- ggplot(data=exam_data,\n            aes(x=MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(aes(tooltip=tooltip),\n                           stackgroups = TRUE,\n                           binwidth = 1,\n                           method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,\n                     breaks= NULL)  #null to suppress axis labels\n\ngirafe(ggobj=p,\n       width_svg = 8,\n       height_svg = 8*0.618)\n\nThe first three lines of codes in the code chunk create a new field called tooltip. At the same time, it populates text in ID and CLASS fields into the newly created field. Next, this newly created field is used as tooltip field as shown in the code of line 7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractivity\n\n\n\nBy hovering the mouse pointer on an data point of interest, the student’s ID and Class will be displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.3 Customising Tooltip style\nCode chunk below uses opts_tooltip() of ggiraph to customize tooltip rendering by add css declarations.\n\ntooltip_css <- 'background-color:palegreen; font-style:bold; color:black;'  #<<<\n\nexam_data$tooltip <- c(paste0(\"Name= \",\n                              exam_data$ID,\n                              \"\\n Class= \",\n                              exam_data$CLASS))\n\np <- ggplot(data=exam_data,\n            aes(x=MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(aes(tooltip=tooltip),\n                           stackgroups = TRUE,\n                           binwidth = 1,\n                           method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,\n                     breaks= NULL)  #null to suppress axis labels\n\ngirafe(ggobj=p,\n       width_svg = 8,\n       height_svg = 8*0.618,\n       options = list(          #<<<\n         opts_tooltip(          #<<<\n           css=tooltip_css\n         )\n       ))\n\nNotice that the background colour of the tooltip is palegreen and the font colour is black and bold. For demonstration purposes, we can also make the font italic and change the font size.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRefer to Customizing girafe objects to learn more about how to customise ggiraph objects.\n\n\n\n3.4.4 Displaying statistics on tooltip\nCode chunk below shows an advanced way to customise tooltip. In this example, a function is used to compute 90% confident interval of the mean. The derived statistics are then displayed in the tooltip.\n\ntooltip <- function(y, ymax, accuracy = 0.01) {\n  mean <- scales::number(y, accuracy = accuracy)\n  sem <- scales:: number (ymax-y, accuracy = accuracy)\n  paste(\"mean maths scores:\" , mean, \"+/-\", sem)\n}\n\n\ngg_point <- ggplot(data=exam_data,\n                   aes(x = RACE)) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y=MATHS,\n                   tooltip = after_stat(tooltip(y, ymax))),\n               fun.data = mean_se,\n               geom = GeomInteractiveCol,\n               fill = 'lightblue') +\n  stat_summary(aes(y= MATHS),\n               fun.data = mean_se,\n               geom= 'errorbar',\n               width = 0.2,\n               size = 0.2)\n\ngirafe(ggobj=gg_point,\n       width_svg = 8,\n       height_svg = 8 * 0.618)\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATION of the codes above\n\nTooltip self defined function:\n\n\nIt takes in two arguments (y and ymax) from results of stat_summary() via after_stat(). accuracy is a fixed parameter and has a value of 0.01.\nscales:: number is to convert number to text, with formatting.\nsem output: If ymax = y + se , then in tooltip, sem = ymax-y, isnt sem = se?\nIt outputs \"mean maths scores: 57.44 +/- 2.03\"\n\n\nStat_summary function creates another geom layer. The first stat summary function has two aes mappings to visual: (1)MATHS as Y (2)tooltip output\n\n\nIt first applies mean_se method to output y, ymin, ymax for each X value (usually categorical)\nAfter this, these groups of 3 values are send into tooltip function via after_stat() helper function\nGeomInteractive makes the columns interactive so tooltips is displayed when users hover over\n\n\nThe second stat summary uses y,ymin, ymax obtained from method= mean_se to plot the error bar\n\nDOUCUMENTATION\nmean_se\nstat_summary(aes(fun.data=mean_se) is default. mean_se(x, mult = 1). When input a list of values, it returns a data frame with three columns:\ny: The mean.\nymin: The mean minus the multiples of the standard error.\nymax: The mean plus the multiples of the standard error.\nThere are a few summary functions from the Hmisc package which are reformatted for use in stat_summary(). They all return aesthetics for y, ymax, and ymin.\nmean_cl_normal() Returns sample mean and 95% confidence intervals assuming normality (i.e., t-distribution based)\nmean_sdl() Returns sample mean and a confidence interval based on the standard deviation times some constant\nmean_cl_boot() Uses a bootstrap method to determine a confidence interval for the sample mean without assuming normality.\nmedian_hilow() Returns the median and an upper and lower quantiles.\n\n\n3.4.5 Hover effect with data_id aesthetic\nCode chunk below shows the second interactive feature of ggiraph, namely data_id.\n\np <- ggplot(data= exam_data,\n            aes(x=MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(aes(data_id=CLASS),\n                           stackgroups = TRUE,\n                           binwidth= 1,\n                           method = 'histodot') +\n  scale_y_continuous( NULL,\n                      breaks = NULL)\n\ngirafe(ggobj=p,\n       width_svg = 8,\n       height_svg = 8 *0.618)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\n\nInteractivity: Elements associated with a data_id (i.e CLASS) will be highlighted upon mouse over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the default value of the hover css is hover_css = “fill:orange;”.\n\n\n3.4.6 Styling hover effect\nIn the code chunk below, css codes are used to change the highlighting effect.\n\np <- ggplot(data=exam_data,\n            aes(x=MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(aes(data_id = CLASS),\n                           stackgroups = TRUE,\n                           binwidth = 1,\n                           method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,\n                     breaks= NULL)  #null to suppress axis labels\n\ngirafe(ggobj=p,\n       width_svg = 6,\n       height_svg = 6*0.618,\n       options = list(                          #<<<\n         opts_hover(css='fill: #202020;'),      #<<<\n         opts_hover_inv(css = 'opacity: 0.2;')  #<<<\n         )\n       )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\n\nInteractivity: Elements associated with a data_id (i.e CLASS) will be highlighted upon mouse over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Different from previous example (tooltip_css is pre-defined as input to a parameter in girafe(options=list(opts_tooltip(css=tooltip_css)))), in this example the ccs customisation request are encoded directly as girafe(options=list(opts_hover(css='tooltip_css'fill:#202020;')))\n\n\n3.4.7 Combining tooltip and hover effect\nThere are time that we want to combine tooltip and hover effect on the interactive statistical graph as shown in the code chunk below.\n\np <- ggplot(data=exam_data,\n            aes(x=MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(aes(tooltip = CLASS,  #<<<\n                               data_id = CLASS),  #<<<\n                           stackgroups = TRUE,\n                           binwidth = 1,\n                           method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,\n                     breaks= NULL)  #null to suppress axis labels\n\ngirafe(ggobj=p,\n       width_svg = 6,\n       height_svg = 6*0.618,\n       options = list(                          #<<<\n         opts_hover(css='fill: blue;'),      #<<<\n         opts_hover_inv(css = 'opacity: 0.2;')  #<<<\n         )\n       )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\n\nInteractivity: Elements associated with a data_id (i.e CLASS) will be highlighted upon mouse over.

    "text": "When telling a visually-driven data story, animated graphics tends to attract the interest of the audience and make deeper impression than static graphics. In this hands-on exercise, I will learn how to create animated data visualisation by using gganimate and plotly r packages. At the same time, I will also learn how to\n(i) reshape data by using tidyr package, and\n(ii) process, wrangle and transform data by using dplyr package.\n\n\nWhen creating animations, the plot does not actually move. Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames, just like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot when conveying motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregate data. The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.\n\n\n\n\nBefore we dive into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it’s important to understand some of the key concepts and terminology related to this type of visualization.\n\nFrame: In an animated line graph, each frame represents a different point in time or a different category. When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.\nAnimation Attributes: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves. For example, you can specify the duration of each frame, the easing function used to transition between frames, and whether to start the animation from the current frame or from the beginning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBeforewe start making animated graphs, we should first ask ourself: Does it makes sense to go through the effort? If we are conducting an exploratory data analysis, a animated graphic may not be worth the time investment. However, if we are giving a presentation, a few well-placed animated graphics can help an audience connect with our topic remarkably better than static counterparts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will use p_load from pacman package to check, install and load the following R packages:\n\nplotly, R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs.\ngganimate, an ggplot extension for creating animated statistical graphs.\ngifski converts video frames to GIF animations using pngquant’s fancy features for efficient cross-frame palettes and temporal dithering. It produces animated GIFs that use thousands of colors per frame.\ngapminder: An excerpt of the data available at Gapminder.org. We just want to use its country_colors scheme.\ntidyverse, a family of modern R packages specially designed to support data science, analysis and communication task including creating static statistical graphs.\n\n\npacman::p_load(readxl, gifski, gapminder, plotly, gganimate, tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, the Data worksheet from GlobalPopulation Excel workbook will be used.\nWrite a code chunk to import Data worksheet from GlobalPopulation Excel workbook by using appropriate R package from tidyverse family.\n\ncol <- c('Country', 'Continent')\n\nglobalPop <- read_xls('data/GlobalPopulation.xls',\n                      sheet='Data') %>% \n  mutate_each_(funs(factor(.)), col) %>%\n  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))\n\n\nglimpse(globalPop)\n\nRows: 6,204\nColumns: 6\n$ Country    <fct> \"Afghanistan\", \"Afghanistan\", \"Afghanistan\", \"Afghanistan\",…\n$ Year       <int> 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014,…\n$ Young      <dbl> 83.6, 84.1, 84.6, 85.1, 84.5, 84.3, 84.1, 83.7, 82.9, 82.1,…\n$ Old        <dbl> 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.6, 4.6, 4.6, 4.6, 4.7, 4.7, 4.7,…\n$ Population <dbl> 21559.9, 22912.8, 23898.2, 25268.4, 28513.7, 31057.0, 32738…\n$ Continent  <fct> Asia, Asia, Asia, Asia, Asia, Asia, Asia, Asia, Asia, Asia,…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code\n\n\n\n\nread_xls() of readxl package is used to import the Excel worksheet.\nmutate_each_() of dplyr package is used to convert all character data type into factor.\n\nThis line applies the factor() function to each column specified in the col argument. Character to factor. It takes column indices or column names in strings format as inputs, and returns a data frame with new columns for each column in the input data frame, where each new column is the result of applying the specified function to the corresponding column in the input data frame.\nThe fun argument specifies the function to apply to each column, and factor(.) is a way to specify the factor works as an argument.\n\nmutate of dplyr package is used to convert data values of Year field into integer.\n\nas.character(x), as.integer(x), as.numeric(x), as.factor(x) (for categorical data)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngganimate extends the grammar of graphics as implemented by ggplot2 to include the description of animation. It does this by providing a range of new grammar classes that can be added to the plot object in order to customise how it should change with time.\n\ntransition_*() defines how the data should be spread out and how it relates to itself across time.\nview_*() defines how the positional scales should change along the animation.\nshadow_*() defines how data from other points in time should be presented in the given point in time.\nenter_*()/exit_*() defines how new data should appear and how old data should disappear during the course of the animation.\nease_aes() defines how different aesthetics should be eased during transitions.\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, the basic ggplot2 functions are used to create a static bubble plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA bubble plot is created when a third numeric variable is assigned to size argument inside a ggplot with geom_point.\n\n\n\nggplot(data= globalPop,\n       aes(x= Old,\n           y=Young,\n           size= Population,\n           color=Country)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7,\n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_color_manual(values=country_colors) +  #<<< who has defined country_colors?\n  scale_size(range= c(2,12)) +\n  labs(title='Year:{frame_time}',\n       x = '% Aged',\n       y= '% Young')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code\n\n\n\n\nThe scale_size(range= c(2,12)) sets the range of point sizes to be used in the plot to between 2 and 12.\nPopulation is mapped to size aes in ggplot, thus this range parameter controls the min nad max size of the points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below,\n\ntransition_time() of gganimate is used to create transition through distinct states in time (i.e. Year).\nease_aes() is used to control easing of aesthetics. The default is linear. Other methods are: quadratic, cubic, quartic, quintic, sine, circular, exponential, elastic, back, and bounce.\n\n\nggplot(data= globalPop,\n       aes(x= Old,\n           y=Young,\n           size= Population,\n           color=Country)) +\n  geom_point( alpha = 0.7,\n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_color_manual(values=country_colors) +  #<<< gapminder lib\n  scale_size(range= c(2,12)) +\n  labs(title='Year:{frame_time}',\n       x = '% Aged',\n       y= '% Young') +\n  transition_time(Year) +\n  ease_aes(\"linear\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Plotly R package, both ggplotly() and plot_ly() support key frame animations through the frame argument/aesthetic. They also support an ids argument/aesthetic to ensure smooth transitions between objects with the same id (which helps facilitate object constancy).\n\n\nIn this sub-section, I will learn how to create an animated bubble plot by using ggplotly() method.\n\ngg <- ggplot(globalPop, \n       aes(x = Old, \n           y = Young, \n           size = Population, \n           colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(aes(size = Population,    #<<< perform aes mapping for each frame\n                 frame = Year),\n             alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young')\n\nggplotly(gg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above\n\n\n\n\nAppropriate ggplot2 functions are used to create a static bubble plot. The output is then saved as an R object called gg.\nggplotly() is then used to convert the R graphic object into an animated svg object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this sub-section, you will learn how to create an animated bubble plot by using plot_ly() method.\n\nbp <- globalPop %>% \n  plot_ly( x = ~Old,\n           y= ~Young,\n           color = ~Continent,#<< 6 unique\n           frame= ~Year,\n           text= ~Country,\n           hoverinfo='text',\n           type = 'scatter',\n           mode= 'markers')\n\n\nbp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\nVisit this link for a very interesting implementation of gganimate by your senior.\nBuilding an animation step-by-step with gganimate.\nCreating a composite gif with multiple gganimate panels"

It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories.\nThat’s because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.\nWhen we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10. It can be defined mathematically as\n\n\n\nThe Schwarz criterion is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough approximation of the Bayes Factor.\n\n\n\n\nA Bayes Factor can be any positive number. One of the most common interpretations is this one—first proposed by Harold Jeffereys (1961) and slightly modified by Lee and Wagenmakers in 2013:\n\n\n\nReference website from r-bloggers\nThe one-sample Wilcoxon test (non parametric) will tell us whether the scores are significantly different from 60 or not (and thus whether they are different from 60 in the population or not)\nH0: EL scores = 60\nH1: EL scores != 60\nThe scores are assumed to be independent (a student’s score is not impacted or influenced by the score of another student)\n\nwilcox.test(exam$ENGLISH,\n            mu = 60)\n\n\n    Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction\n\ndata:  exam$ENGLISH\nV = 38743, p-value = 3.435e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true location is not equal to 60\n\n\nInterpretation\nP-value<0.05, we have enough statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the EL scores are significantly different from 60.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBy default, it is a two-tailed test that is done. As for the t.test() function, we can specify that a one-sided test is required by using either the alternative = “greater” or alternative = “less argument in the wilcox.test() function.\n\n\nCombine statistical test and plot\n\nset.seed(1234)\n\ngghistostats(data=exam,\n             x = ENGLISH,\n             type='nonparametric', #nonparametric (median) = Wilcoxon, parametric = t-test (default is look for mean and unequal variance method)\n             test.value =60,\n             conf.level = 0.95,\n             xlab = 'English scores')\n\n\n\n\nDid we forget to check if English scores follow a normal distribution?

The normality assumption is important because it affects the validity of statistical inference procedures such as hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.\nIf the residuals are not normally distributed, it may indicate that the linear regression model is not a good fit for the data and that alternative modeling approaches may be needed.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk, check_heteroscedasticity() of performance package.\nHeteroscedasticity refers to a situation where the variance of the errors (or residuals) in the linear regression model is not constant across different levels of the predictor variable(s).\nIf heteroscedasticity is detected, there are several ways to address it, including transforming the data, using weighted least squares regression, or using robust standard errors. In DAl, we rebuild another model by creating subclasses out of the original Y variable.\n\ncheck_h <- check_heteroscedasticity(model1)\n\n\nplot(check_h)\n\n\n\n\nFrom the graph above, there is a slight sign of heteroscedasticity as the residuals seem to be funnelled outwards as the fitted values increase.\n\n\n\nWe can also perform the complete check by using check_model().\n\ncheck_model(model1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code below, plot() of see package and parameters() of parameters package is used to visualise the parameters of a regression model.\n\nplot(parameters(model1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code below, ggcoefstats() of ggstatsplot package to visualise the parameters of a regression model.\n\nggcoefstats(model1, \n            output = \"plot\")"

Table and plot have coordinated views.\nRecall in hands-on 3 that we create can create interactive plots using ggiraph and ggplot geometries that can understand 3 arguments; namely tooltip, data_id and onclick.\nI will use one of them methods (geom_errorbar_interactive with girafe) to construct here. The other method is to use plotly.\nSTEP 1: CREATE INTERACTIVE ERROR BAR for 99% CI\n\n\nCode\n# create a new column tooltip to contain the tooltip text.\nmy_sum$tooltip <- c(paste0(\"RACE: \",\n                           my_sum$RACE,\n                           \"\\n N= \",\n                            my_sum$n,\n                           \"\\n Ave Score: \",\n                           round(my_sum$mean, digits=2)\n                           ))\n\np <- ggplot(my_sum) +\n  geom_errorbar_interactive(aes(x=reorder(RACE,-mean),\n                    ymin=mean-2.58*se,    #<<<< formula to calc 95% CI\n                    ymax=mean+ 2.58*se,\n                    tooltip=tooltip),  \n                width = 0.2,\n                colour = 'black',\n                alpha = 0.9,\n                size=0.5) +\n    geom_point(aes(x=RACE,\n                 y=mean),\n             stat = 'identity', #<<< actual points refer to mean \n             color='red', \n             size = 1.5,\n             alpha = 1) + \n  labs(title='99% confidence interval of maths score by race',\n       x = 'Race') +\n  theme(axis.title.y=element_text(angle = 0,\n                                  vjust=0.9),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n        axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n        axis.line = element_line(size = 0.2))\n\ngirafe(ggobj = p,\n       width_svg = 8,\n       height_svg = 8*0.618)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTEP 2: CREATE AN INTERACTIVE DATA TABLE USING DT()\n\nWe use the %>% operator to pipe the data frame into the mutate_if() function, where we specify the condition is.numeric to select only the numeric columns. We use the tilde ~ symbol to specify the rounding function, and pass the digits argument to round to two decimal places. The resulting data frame df will have all numerical columns rounded to two decimal places.\n\n\n\nCode\n# Round all numerical columns to two decimal places\nmy_sum <- my_sum %>% \n  mutate_if(is.numeric, ~ round(., digits = 2))\n\nDT::datatable(my_sum, class='compact')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTEP 3: COMBINE BOTH\nNext, combine uncertainty graph and plotly interactive table using Crosstalk, which is an add-on to the htmlwidgets package.

As a result, the plot and table were both not able to communicate with each other.\nWrongly added geom_errorbar_interactive(aes(tooltip) and girafe together with plotly and crosstalk::bscols. As as result, no error bars were seen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggdist is an R package that provides a flexible set of ggplot2 geoms and stats designed especially for visualising distributions and uncertainty.\nIt is designed for both frequentist and Bayesian uncertainty visualization, taking the view that uncertainty visualization can be unified through the perspective of distribution visualization:\n\nfor frequentist models, one visualises confidence distributions or bootstrap distributions (see vignette(“freq-uncertainty-vis”));\nfor Bayesian models, one visualises probability distributions (see the tidybayes package, which builds on top of ggdist).\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, stat_pointinterval() of ggdist is used to build a visual for displaying distribution of maths scores by race.\nstat_pointinterval means points and multiple intervals. The default confidence interval us 95%. To change the level to 99%, add conf.level = 0.99 to stat_pointinterval function.\nTake note that the default .width values are set to c(0.66, 0.95) confidence intervals.\n\n\nCode\nexam %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x=RACE,       #<< plot the base layer\n             y=MATHS)) +\n  stat_pointinterval() +   #<< .width=c(0.66,0.95)\n  labs(\n    title='Visualising confidence intervals of mean math score',\n    subtitle = \"Mean Point + Multiple-interval plot 66% and 95%\")\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the arguments (there are many , have to read the syntax reference for more details)\n\n.width: For intervals, the interval width as a numeric value in [0, 1]. For slabs, the width of the smallest interval containing that value of the slab.\npoint_interval: This function determines the point summary (typically mean, median, or mode) and interval type (quantile interval, qi; highest-density interval, hdi; or highest-density continuous interval, hdci)\n\n\nCode\nexam %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = RACE, y = MATHS)) +\n  stat_pointinterval(.width = 0.95,\n  .point = median,\n  .interval = qi) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Visualising confidence intervals of mean math score\",\n    subtitle = \"Mean Point + Multiple-interval plot, 95% only\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask: Makeover the plot on previous slide by showing 95% and 99% confidence intervals.\n\n\nCode\nexam %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = RACE, y = MATHS)) +\n  \n  #Using stat_pointinterval to plot the points and intervals\n  stat_pointinterval(.width = c(0.95,0.99),\n  .point = median,\n  .interval = qi,\n  aes(interval_color=stat(level)),\n  show.legend = FALSE) +\n  \n  #Defining the color of the intervals \n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\"blue\", \"darkblue\"),\n    aesthetics = \"interval_color\") +\n  \n  #Title, subtitle, and caption\n  labs(\n    title = \"Visualising confidence intervals of mean math score\",\n    subtitle = \"Mean Point + Multiple-interval plot, 95% and 99%\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nstat(level) calculates the confidence interval limits based on the specified conf.level argument, and interval_color maps the calculated interval color to the interval_color argument.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, stat_gradientinterval() of ggdist is used to build a visual for displaying distribution of maths scores by race.\n\n\nCode\nexam %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = RACE, \n             y = MATHS)) +\n  stat_gradientinterval(   \n    fill = \"green\",      \n    show.legend = TRUE     \n  ) +                        \n  labs(\n    title = \"Visualising confidence intervals of mean math score\",\n    subtitle = \"Gradient + interval plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Installing ungeviz package\n\n#devtools::install_github(\"wilkelab/ungeviz\")\n\n\nlibrary(ungeviz)\n\nWhat are HOPs? Rather than showing a continuous probability distribution, Hypothetical Outcome Plots (or HOPs) visualize a set of draws from a distribution, where each draw is shown as a new plot in either a small multiples or animated form.\nExplanation of the code below:\nThe code is creating a ggplot object to visualize the distribution of MATHS scores for different races in the exam dataset using the geom_point() and geom_hpline() functions from ggplot2.\nSpecifically, it is creating a scatterplot (geom_point()) of MATHS scores against RACE with some jitter (position_jitter()) added to the points to avoid overplotting. The factor() function is used to convert the RACE variable to a categorical variable.\nAdditionally, a horizontal line (geom_hpline()) is added to the plot to represent the median MATHS score for each race, calculated using sampler() function with 25 samples drawn from the original dataset for each race. The line is colored in #D55E00.\nThe transition_states() function is used to create an animation by specifying the .draw column as the states for the animation. The animation has 3 states (1, 2, 3) and will animate the plot with a transition between each state.\nFinally, the theme_bw() function is used to set the theme of the plot to a black and white color scheme.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data = exam, \n       (aes(x = factor(RACE), y = MATHS))) +\n  geom_point(position = position_jitter(\n    height = 0.3, width = 0.05), \n    size = 0.4, color = \"#0072B2\", alpha = 1/2) +\n  geom_hpline(data = sampler(25, group = RACE), height = 0.6, color = \"#D55E00\") +\n  theme_bw() + \n  # `.draw` is a generated column indicating the sample draw\n  transition_states(.draw, 1, 3)\n\n\n\n\n\nA jitter plot is a variant of the strip plot with a better view of overlapping data points, used to visualise the distribution of many individual one-dimensional values. The values are plotted as dots along one axis, and the dots are then shifted randomly along the other axis, which has no meaning in itself data-wise, allowing the dots not to overlap."

It aims to enhance my working experience of ggplot2 to customise speciallised data visualisation like funnel plot.\n\n11.5.1 Computing the basic derived fields\nTo plot the funnel plot from scratch, we need to derive cumulative death rate (rate) and standard error of cumulative death rate (rate.se). Take note that the formula for SE of Proportions will be used here. (Lecture 4 slide 25)\n\ndf <- covid19 %>%\n  mutate(rate = Death / Positive) %>%\n  mutate(rate.se = sqrt((rate*(1-rate)) / (Positive))) %>%\n  filter(rate > 0)\n\nNext, the fit.mean is computed by using the code chunk below.\nThe function calculates the weighted mean of the rate column in the df data frame, where the weights are the inverse squares of the corresponding standard errors (rate.se).\n\nfit.mean <- weighted.mean(df$rate, 1/df$rate.se^2)\n\n\nfit.mean\n\n[1] 0.01496959\n\n\n\n\n11.5.2 Calculate lower and upper limits for 95% and 99.9% CI\nThe code chunk below is used to compute the lower and upper limits for 95% confidence interval.\nThe number.seq creates a sequence of numbers from 1 to the maximum number of positive cases in the data frame. (max = 6231)\nWe then calculate the lower and upper 95% confidence intervals and the lower and upper 99.9% confidence intervals for the mean rate of death at each number in the sequence.\nFinally, a new data frame dfCI is created that contains the lower and upper confidence intervals and mean rate of death for each number in the sequence.\n\n\nCode\nnumber.seq <- seq(1, max(df$Positive), 1)\nnumber.ll95 <- fit.mean - 1.96 * sqrt((fit.mean*(1-fit.mean)) / (number.seq)) \nnumber.ul95 <- fit.mean + 1.96 * sqrt((fit.mean*(1-fit.mean)) / (number.seq)) \nnumber.ll999 <- fit.mean - 3.29 * sqrt((fit.mean*(1-fit.mean)) / (number.seq)) \nnumber.ul999 <- fit.mean + 3.29 * sqrt((fit.mean*(1-fit.mean)) / (number.seq)) \n\n# creates a new dataframe using data.frame()\ndfCI <- data.frame(number.ll95, number.ul95, number.ll999, \n                   number.ul999, number.seq, fit.mean)\n\n\n\n\n11.5.3 Plotting a static funnel plot\nIn the code chunk below, ggplot2 functions are used to plot a static funnel plot.\n\n\nCode\np <- ggplot(df, aes(x = Positive, y = rate)) +  #<<< death rates vs positive case\n  geom_point(aes(label=`Sub-district`), \n             alpha=0.4) +\n  \n  # 95% line is dashed\n  geom_line(data = dfCI, \n            aes(x = number.seq, \n                y = number.ll95), \n            size = 0.4, \n            colour = \"grey40\", \n            linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_line(data = dfCI, \n            aes(x = number.seq, \n                y = number.ul95), \n            size = 0.4, \n            colour = \"grey40\", \n            linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  \n  # 99% line is solid\n  geom_line(data = dfCI, \n            aes(x = number.seq, \n                y = number.ll999), \n            size = 0.4, \n            colour = \"grey40\") +\n  geom_line(data = dfCI, \n            aes(x = number.seq, \n                y = number.ul999), \n            size = 0.4, \n            colour = \"grey40\") +\n  geom_hline(data = dfCI, \n             aes(yintercept = fit.mean), \n             size = 0.4, \n             colour = \"grey40\") +\n  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,0.05)) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 1, y = -0.13, label = \"95%\", size = 3, colour = \"grey40\") + \n  annotate(\"text\", x = 4.5, y = -0.18, label = \"99%\", size = 3, colour = \"grey40\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Cumulative Fatality Rate by Cumulative Number of COVID-19 Cases\") +\n  xlab(\"Cumulative Number of COVID-19 Cases\") + \n  ylab(\"Cumulative Fatality Rate\") +\n  theme_light() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=12),\n        legend.position = c(0.91,0.85), \n        legend.title = element_text(size=7),\n        legend.text = element_text(size=7),\n        legend.background = element_rect(colour = \"grey60\", linetype = \"dotted\"),\n        legend.key.height = unit(0.3, \"cm\"))\np\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.5.4 Interactive Funnel Plot: plotly + ggplot2\nThe funnel plot created using ggplot2 functions can be made interactive with ggplotly() of plotly r package.\n\n\nCode\nfp_ggplotly <- ggplotly(p,\n  tooltip = c(\"label\", \n              \"x\", \n              \"y\"))\nfp_ggplotly"

    "text": "2.3 Data Issues and wrangling\nI will discuss the issues in the datasets and proposed cleaning methods.\n\n2.3.1 finance dataset issues:\n\nparticipantId should be converted from <dbl> format to <chr> format. It should be a categorical and not numerical data type.\ntimestamp should be converted from <dttm> format to <date> format as I will not be analysing time in this exercise.\nNegative values of amount that belong to the expenses categories should be converted to positive values. The amount will also be rounded to two decimal places.\n\nThe code chunk below does the following:\n\nuse the as.character() function to convert participantId to <chr> format\ncreate a new column month_year by extracting the year and month from the timestamp column using the format() function with the %Y-%m format specifier.\nuse the abs() function to convert negative values amount to positive and round the values to 2 decimal places using the round() function.\n\n\n# Convert participantId to character\nfinance <- finance %>% mutate(participantId = as.character(participantId))\n\n# Extract month and year from timestamp\nfinance <- finance %>% \n  mutate(month_year = format(timestamp, \"%m-%Y\"))\n\n# Transform negative amounts to positive and round to 2 decimal places\nfinance <- finance %>% \n  mutate(amount = abs(amount),\n         amount = round(amount, 2))\n\nA check for duplicates using the duplicated() function reveals that there are 1,113 records of duplicates.\n\nThe duplicated() function to identify the duplicate rows. It returns a logical vector indicating whether each row is a duplicate of a previous row in the data frame. We can then use this logical vector to subset the data frame and show the duplicate rows. The logical vector is stored in a filter duplicated_rows which is used to subset the finance data.\n\n\n# Show duplicate rows\nduplicated_rows <- finance[duplicated(finance),]\nglimpse(duplicated_rows)\n\nRows: 1,113\nColumns: 5\n$ participantId <chr> \"0\", \"0\", \"1\", \"1\", \"2\", \"2\", \"3\", \"3\", \"4\", \"4\", \"5\", \"…\n$ timestamp     <dttm> 2022-03-01, 2022-03-01, 2022-03-01, 2022-03-01, 2022-03…\n$ category      <chr> \"Shelter\", \"Education\", \"Shelter\", \"Education\", \"Shelter…\n$ amount        <dbl> 554.99, 38.01, 554.99, 38.01, 556.55, 12.81, 554.99, 38.…\n$ month_year    <chr> \"03-2022\", \"03-2022\", \"03-2022\", \"03-2022\", \"03-2022\", \"…\n\n\n\nunique() function is used to remove the duplicate rows form finance data\n\n\n# Remove duplicate rows\nfinance <- unique(finance)\n\n\nPerform a final check to verify that there are no more duplicate using any() function\n\n\nany(duplicated(finance))\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nThe last thing to do is to create a new column date that is in <date> format using the as.Date function.\n\nthe paste0() function is used to concatenate “01-” with each value in the month_year column. This is because as.Date() requires a complete date in the format “dd-mm-yyyy”\n\nfinance$date <- as.Date(paste0(\"01-\", finance$month_year), format = \"%d-%m-%Y\")\n\n\nOther issues\nWhen the finance dataset is group-by the date variable , it is noticed that the number of distinct participantID who took part in the survey was 1,011 in March 2022 and suddenly reduced to a constant value of 880 from April 2022 onwards. It seems to suggest that there are 131 residents who moved out of the city at the end of March 2022.\nIn the code chunk below:\n\ndataset is group-by date and the distinct count of participantID is generated using n_distinct function\nthe missing dataframe is displayed below using knitr::kable() function\n\n\nmissing_summary <- finance %>%\n  group_by(date) %>% \n  summarise(n_distinct=n_distinct(participantId)) %>% \n  rename(`Number of unique participantId` = n_distinct)\n\nknitr::kable(missing_summary, \"simple\")\n\n\n\n\ndate\nNumber of unique participantId\n\n\n\n\n2022-03-01\n1011\n\n\n2022-04-01\n880\n\n\n2022-05-01\n880\n\n\n2022-06-01\n880\n\n\n2022-07-01\n880\n\n\n2022-08-01\n880\n\n\n2022-09-01\n880\n\n\n2022-10-01\n880\n\n\n2022-11-01\n880\n\n\n2022-12-01\n880\n\n\n2023-01-01\n880\n\n\n2023-02-01\n880\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 11 out of 12 months of records are missing for these 131 residents, we will delete their records from the finance dataset.\nThe code chunk below does the following:\n\nextract the participantIds of residents whose records exists in March 22 but not in all April 22 using the anti-join function\npass the unique participantId column name as an argument to pull() and use the as.vector() function to convert the resulting tibble column to a vector\nresulting dataframe will only contain participantIds that are in ‘2022-03-01’ but not in ‘2022-04-01’ onwards.

We will zoom into the different categories of expenses below.\n\n\n3.1.2 Zooming into Interactive Line charts of income and expenditures by month\nDesign considerations:\nDue to the large difference in values between wage and other expenses, I have separated income and expense into two graphs. This will enable use to visualise the values of the expense clearly. For the second line plot, the type of expenses are directly labelled beside the lines instead of using a legend as it is more user-friendly this way.\nThere are several manual adjustments that I made to the graph and the key ones are shown below:\n\nthe color aesthetic within each geom_line maps the name of the variable to a specific color. Then, the scale_color_manual function is used to assign the desired colors to each variable name.\nscale_x_date() is used to display all the values in the x-axis with the date format “%Y-%m”.\nscale_y_continuous() with labels = comma is used to format the y-axis labels with commas, otherwise it will appear as index notation.\ntheme_light() is used to set the plot background to white and remove the grid lines.\nelement_line() is used to increase the axis line width.\nlegend.position = \"none\" is used to remove the legend since they are manually labelled using geom_text.\nlegend.title = element_blank() is used to remove the legend title.\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(scales)\n\nq1<-highlevel %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = date)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = Wage, color = \"Red\", linetype = \"Wage\"), size = 1) +\n\n  \n  #

Hovering the mouse above the heatmaps will reveal the annual recreation spending and joviality index in the tooltip. The median joviality index is chosen because it is a point where the maximum distance between the smallest and highest spending or index is reduced. What inteeresting patterns can you see?\nI can see that interest group J has higher recreation spending as compared to the rest and residents from the ‘low’ education level are contributing to it. From the joviality heatmap on the right, I also notice the same group of people are happiest of all. It makes me wonder what interest group it is in real life.\nI will be performing CDA to compare the annual recreation spends in joviality index across education levels later.\n\n\n3.1.4 Interactive bubble plots of (Savings, Recreation, Shelter, Food and Jovality) against wage\nPending"
