They are\n\n-   control the placement of annotation on a graph by using functions provided in ggrepel package,\n\n-   create professional publication quality figure by using functions provided in ggthemes and hrbrthemes packages,\n\n-   plot composite figure by combining ggplot2 graphs by using patchwork package.\n\n## 2.2 Getting started\n\n### 2.2.1 Installing and loading the required libraries\n\nIn this exercise, beside tidyverse, four R packages will be used. They are:\n\n-   ggrepel: an R package provides geoms for ggplot2 to repel overlapping text labels.\n\n-   ggthemes: an R package provides some extra themes, geoms, and scales for \\'ggplot2\\'.\n\n-   hrbrthemes: an R package provides typography-centric themes and theme components for ggplot2.\n\n-   patchwork: an R package for preparing composite figure created using ggplot2.\n\nCode chunk below will be used to check if these packages have been installed and also will load them onto my working R environment.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman:: p_load(ggrepel, patchwork, ggthemes, hrbrthemes, tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### 2.2.2 Importing data\n\nFor the purpose of this exercise, a data file called *Exam_data* will be used. It consists of year end examination grades of a cohort of primary 3 students from a local school. It is in csv file format.\n\nThe code chunk below imports *exam_data.csv* into R environment by using [*read_csv()*](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html) function of [**readr**](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) package. **readr** is one of the tidyverse package.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nexam_data <- read_csv('data/Exam_data.csv')\n```\n:::\n\n\nThere are a total of seven attributes in the exam_data tibble data frame. Four of them are categorical data type and the other three are in continuous data type.\n\n-   The categorical attributes are: ID, CLASS, GENDER and RACE.\n\n-   The continuous attributes are: MATHS, ENGLISH and SCIENCE.\n\n## 2.3 Beyond ggplot2 Annotation: ggrepel\n\nOne of the challenge in plotting statistical graph is annotation, especially with large number of data points.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n#### The plot\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n#### The code chunk\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data=exam_data,\n       aes(y=ENGLISH, x=MATHS)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  geom_label(aes(label=ID))\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
