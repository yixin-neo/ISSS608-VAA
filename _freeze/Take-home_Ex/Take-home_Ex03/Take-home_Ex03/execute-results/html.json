We will also be categorising the type of business relationship patterns found.\n\n# 1 About the dataset\n\n## 1.1 Data dictionary\n\n**Node Attributes:**\n\n-   id \\-- Name of the company that originated (or received) the shipment\n\n-   shpcountry \\-- Country the company most often associated with when shipping\n\n-   rcvcountry \\-- Country the company most often associated with when receiving\n\n-   dataset \\-- Always 'MC2'\n\n**Edge Attributes:**\n\n-   arrivaldate \\-- Date the shipment arrived at port in YYYY-MM-DD format.\n\n-   hscode \\-- Harmonized System code for the shipment. Can be joined with the hscodes table to get additional details.\n\n-   valueofgoods_omu \\-- Customs-declared value of the total shipment, in Oceanus\n\n-   Monetary Units (OMU)\n\n-   volumeteu \\-- The volume of the shipment in 'Twenty-foot equivalent units', roughly how many 20-foot standard containers would be required. (Actual number of containers may have been different as there are 20ft and 40ft standard containers and tankers that do not use containers)\n\n-   weightkg \\-- The weight of the shipment in kilograms (if known)\n\n-   dataset \\-- Always 'MC2'\n\n-   type \\-- Always 'shipment' for MC2\n\n-   generated_by \\-- Name of the program that generated the edge. (Only found on 'bundle' records.)\n\n## 1.2 Importing the datasets\n\nImport libraries\n\nThe new libraries used today are :\n\n-   `jsonlite` to import json file\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(jsonlite, igraph, tidygraph, ggraph,\n               visNetwork, lubridate, clock,\n               tidyverse, graphlayouts,knitr,plotly, \n               ggHoriPlot, ggthemes,hrbrthemes,treemap,patchwork, ggiraph)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nPull out the nodes and edge data and save them as tibble data frames.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nRearranging the columns in edge file as we require `source` and `target` columns to be the first two columns.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# 2 Data cleaning\n\n## 2.1 Check for null values\n\n# 4 References\n\nhttps://hohenfeld.is/posts/graphs-are-fun-an-introduction-to-graphs-in-r/\n\nOn ggraph edgelink\n\nhttps://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggraph/vignettes/Edges.html\n\nVisnetwork\n\nhttp://datastorm-open.github.io/visNetwork/\n\nHorizon plot\n\nhttps://rivasiker.github.io/ggHoriPlot/\n",
