In today's in class exercise, Prof shared with us how to combine a qqplot and tabular results of Shapiro test in a single plot.

## Import libraries

The new libraries used today are :

-   [rstatic](https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/rstatix/): Allows us to perform basic statistical tests, including t-test, Wilcoxon test, ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis and correlation analyses.

-   [gt()](https://gt.rstudio.com/) : starting from a tibble table, customise a table and export in various formats. Most importantly, it works with patch. We will save the tabular results from shapiro test as gt object and export using gtsave() into .png file later.

    ::: callout-note
    ## On importing data

    -   Importing tidyverse: will automatically provide read_r() \<- for read_csv()

    -   read.csv() will insert '.' between words. Thus we normally use read_csv()

    -   To read excel files, load `readxl` and use read_xls()
    :::

```{r}
pacman::p_load(rstatix, gt, patchwork,tidyverse,nortest)
```

```{r}
exam <- read_csv('C:/yixin-neo/ISSS608-VAA/Hands-on_Ex/Hands-on_Ex05/data/Exam_data.csv')
```

## Background info

### The Anderson_darling test

Usually, when we check for normality of a distribution, we can use the Anderson-darling test or the Shapiro test. Hitting the three commands below will give us the results, but no visualisation.

```{r}
ad.test(exam$ENGLISH)
```

### The shapiro.test

Using shapiro.test will generate result as a HTML object.

```{r}
shapiro.test(exam$ENGLISH)
```

Using shapiro_test will generate result as a tibble object.

```{r}
exam %>% 
  shapiro_test(ENGLISH)
```

### QQplot

We can also generate the qqplot to check for normality. However qqplot does not print any p-values.

```{r}
ggplot(exam,
       aes(sample=ENGLISH)) +  #<<< use a new argument call sample: el scores
  stat_qq() +
  stat_qq_line()
```

## Task for today:

### Combine qqplot with results from Shapiro-test.

Recall that in hands-on 3, we use DT to create an interactive table , however it is not recognized by patchwork.

We start by storing the shapiro test in a tibble table as shown above. Then we will use the [gt()](https://gt.rstudio.com/) package and export it as a .png using gtsave().

```{r}
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-height: 4

qq <- ggplot(exam,
       aes(sample=ENGLISH)) +  #<<< use a new argument call sample: el scores
  stat_qq() +
  stat_qq_line()

sw_t <- exam %>% 
  shapiro_test(ENGLISH) %>% gt()   #<<< make into a gt format (will give a nice table)  shapiro.test is not used here as it gives output in another format.

tmp <- tempfile(fileext = '.png') # create  temp table
gtsave(sw_t, tmp)  # use gtsave() to save sw_t into tmp folder
table_png <- png::readPNG(tmp, native = TRUE)

qq+table_png

```

I tried to customise the gt() table.

```{r}
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-height: 4

qq <- ggplot(exam,
       aes(sample=ENGLISH)) +  #<<< use a new argument call sample: el scores
  stat_qq() +
  stat_qq_line()

sw_t <- exam %>% 
  shapiro_test(ENGLISH) %>% gt()  %>%  
  tab_header(
    title = 'Shapiro Test for Normality',
    subtitle = 'English scores')

tmp <- tempfile(fileext = '.png') # create  temp table
gtsave(sw_t, tmp)  # use gtsave() to save sw_t into tmp folder
table_png <- png::readPNG(tmp, native = TRUE)

qq+table_png  # use patchwork to stitch
```

The results of the Shapiro test shows that p-value \< 0.05 and we have enough statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that English scores do not follow normal distribution.
