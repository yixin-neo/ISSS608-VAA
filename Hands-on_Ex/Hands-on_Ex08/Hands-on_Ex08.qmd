# **Lesson 5: Network Data Visualisation and Analysis**

\*located in chapter 27 of Prof's [E-book](https://r4va.netlify.app/chap27.html)

## Overview

In this hands-on exercise, I will learn how to model, analyse and visualise network data using R.

By the end of this hands-on exercise, I will be able to:

-   create graph object data frames, manipulate them using appropriate functions of *dplyr*, *lubridate*, and *tidygraph*,

-   build network graph visualisation using appropriate functions of *ggraph*,

-   compute network geometrics using *tidygraph*,

-   build advanced graph visualisation by incorporating the network geometrics, and

-   build interactive network visualisation using *visNetwork* package.

## 27.2 Getting Started

### 27.2.1 Installing and launching R packages

In this hands-on exercise, four network data modelling and visualisation packages will be installed and launched. They are igraph, tidygraph, ggraph and visNetwork. Beside these four packages, tidyverse and [lubridate](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/), an R package specially designed to handle and wrangling **time** data will be installed and launched too.

The code chunk:

```{r}
#| code-fold: True
pacman::p_load(igraph, tidygraph, ggraph,
               visNetwork, lubridate, clock,
               tidyverse, graphlayouts,knitr)
```

## 27.3 The Data

The data sets used in this hands-on exercise is from an oil exploration and extraction company. There are two data sets. One contains the nodes data and the other contains the edges (also know as link) data.

### 27.3.1 The edges data

-   *GAStech-email_edges.csv* which consists of two weeks of 9063 emails correspondances between 55 employees.

![](https://r4va.netlify.app/chap27/img/image2.jpg)

### 27.3.2 The nodes data

-   *GAStech_email_nodes.csv* which consist of the names, department and title of the 55 employees.

![](https://r4va.netlify.app/chap27/img/image1.jpg)

### 27.3.3 Importing network data from files

In this step, you will import GAStech_email_node.csv and GAStech_email_edges-v2.csv into RStudio environment by using `read_csv()` of **readr** package.

```{r}
GAStech_nodes <- read_csv('data/GAStech_email_node.csv')
GAStech_edges <- read_csv('data/GAStech_email_edge-v2.csv')
```

### 27.3.4 Reviewing the imported data

Next, we will examine the structure of the data frame using *glimpse()* of **dplyr**.

```{r}
#| code-fold: True
glimpse(GAStech_edges)
# list()
# summary()
# class ()

```

::: callout-warning
The output report of GAStech_edges above reveals that the *SentDate* is treated as "Character" data type instead of *date* data type. We have to change the data type of *SentDate* field back to "Date"" data type.
:::

### 27.3.5 Wrangling time

```{r}
#| code-fold: True
GAStech_edges <- GAStech_edges %>% 
  mutate(SentDate = dmy(SentDate)) %>% 
  mutate(Weekday = wday(SentDate,
                         label = TRUE,  # ordered factor if true
                         abbr = FALSE))
```

```{r}
unique(GAStech_edges %>% pull(Weekday))
```

::: callout-note
## Learning from codes above

-   both *dmy()* and *wday()* are functions of **lubridate** package. [lubridate](https://r4va.netlify.app/cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lubridate/vignettes/lubridate.html) is an R package that makes it easier to work with dates and times.

-   *dmy()* transforms the SentDate to Date data type.

-   *wday()* returns the day of the week as a decimal number (1-7) or an ordered factor (Monday, Tuesday,..) if label is TRUE. The argument abbr is FALSE keep the daya spells in full, i.e. Monday. The function will create a new column in the data.frame i.e. Weekday and the output of *wday()* will save in this newly created field.

-   the values in the *Weekday* field are in ordinal scale.
:::

### 27.3.6 Reviewing the revised date fields

Table below shows the data structure of the reformatted *GAStech_edges* with the correct data formats.

```{r}
#| echo: false
glimpse(GAStech_edges)
# knitr::kable(head(GAStech_edges,5), "simple")
```

### 27.3.7 Wrangling attributes

A close examination of *GAStech_edges* data.frame reveals that it consists of individual e-mail flow records. This is not very useful for visualisation.

In view of this, we will

-   filter `Work related` emails

-   group-by senders, receivers and day of week

-   aggregate to get the total count of each unique combination of the above to get `Weight` as a new column

-   filter twice to remove self-loops and edges that occurred only once

-   **`ungroup()`** function is used to remove the grouping created by **`group_by()`** so that the resulting dataframe is not grouped by any variable(s) anymore. This is useful when we want to apply further operations or analysis to the individual rows of data rather than grouped results.

The code chunk:

```{r}
#| code-fold: True
GAStech_edges_aggregated <- GAStech_edges %>%  # after filter 6935 rows remain
  filter(MainSubject=='Work related') %>% 
  group_by(source, target, Weekday) %>% 
  summarise(Weight = n()) %>%           # 3706 rows remaining and Weight col added
  filter(source != target) %>%          #3493 rows remaining
  filter(Weight >1) %>%                # 1456 rows remaining
  ungroup()                            # 1456 x 4 columns 

```

::: callout-note
## Things to learn from code above

-   four functions from **dplyr** package are used. They are: *filter()*, *group()*, *summarise()*, and *ungroup()*.

-   The output data.frame is called **GAStech_edges_aggregated**.

-   A new field called *Weight* has been added in GAStech_edges_aggregated.

-   After ungroup(), we can analyse row by row instead of by unique combination of source, target and weekday
:::

### 27.3.8 Reviewing the revised edges file

Table below shows the data structure of the reformatted *GAStech_edges_aggregated* data frame

```{r}
#| echo: false
glimpse(GAStech_edges_aggregated)
```

## 27.4 Creating network objects using **tidygraph**

In this section, I will learn how to create a graph data model by using **tidygraph** package. It provides a tidy API for graph/network manipulation. While network data itself is not tidy, it can be envisioned as two tidy tables, one for node data and one for edge data. `tidygraph` provides a way

-   to switch between the two tables and provides dplyr verbs for manipulating them.

-   to access to a lot of graph algorithms with return values that facilitate their use in a tidy workflow.

Before getting started, please read these two articles:

-   [Introducing tidygraph](https://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/introducing-tidygraph/)

-   [tidygraph 1.1 - A tidy hope](https://www.data-imaginist.com/2018/tidygraph-1-1-a-tidy-hope/)

### 27.4.1 The **tbl_graph** object

Two functions of **tidygraph** package can be used to create network objects, they are:

-   [`tbl_graph()`](https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/tbl_graph.html) **creates** a **tbl_graph** network object from nodes and edges data.

-   [`as_tbl_graph()`](https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/tbl_graph.html) **converts** network data and objects to a **tbl_graph** network. Below are network data and objects supported by `as_tbl_graph()`

    -   a node data.frame and an edge data.frame,

    -   data.frame, list, matrix from base,

    -   igraph from igraph,

    -   network from network,

    -   dendrogram and hclust from stats,

    -   Node from data.tree,

    -   phylo and evonet from ape, and

    -   graphNEL, graphAM, graphBAM from graph (in Bioconductor).

### 27.4.2 The **dplyr** verbs in **tidygraph**

-   *activate()* verb from **tidygraph** serves as a switch between tibbles for nodes and edges. All dplyr verbs applied to **tbl_graph** object are applied to the active tibble.

![](https://r4va.netlify.app/chap27/img/image3.jpg){width="756"}

-   In the above the *.N()* function is used to gain access to the node data while manipulating the edge data. Similarly *.E()* will give you the edge data and *.G()* will give you the **tbl_graph** object itself.

-   **`%>% mutate(Species = ifelse(leaf, as.character(iris$Species)[label], NA))`** - This line adds a new column called **`Species`** to the **`nodes`** data frame. The **`ifelse()`** function assigns a value to this column based on whether the node is a leaf or not. If it is a leaf, the value is taken from the **`label`** column of the **`iris$Species`** data frame (which contains the actual species names), and if it is not a leaf, the value is set to **`NA`**.

-   **`%>% mutate(to_setose = .N()$Species[to] == 'setosa')`** - This line adds a new column called **`to_setose`** to the **`edges`** data frame. The **`ifelse()`** function assigns a value to this column based on whether the target node of each edge is a member of the **`setosa`** species or not. The **`to`** variable refers to the index of the target node in the **`nodes`** data frame, and the **`.N()`** function allows access to the **`Species`** column of the **`nodes`** data frame.

### 27.4.3 Using `tbl_graph()` to build tidygraph data model.

In this section, I will use `tbl_graph()` of [**tidygraph**](https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/index.html)package to build an tidygraph's network graph data.frame.

Before typing the codes, review to reference guide of [`tbl_graph()`](https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/tbl_graph.html)

::: callout-note
## Required format of nodes and edges data

GAStech_nodes has ID of nodes as first column. Label is optional?

GAStech_edges_aggregated contains source and target as column 1 and 2.
:::

```{r}
GAStech_graph<- tbl_graph(nodes=GAStech_nodes,
                          edges = GAStech_edges_aggregated,
                          directed = TRUE)
```

### 27.4.4 Reviewing the output tidygraph's graph object

```{r}
GAStech_graph
```

-   The output above reveals that *GAStech_graph* is a tbl_graph object with 54 nodes and 4541 edges.

-   The command also prints the first six rows of "Node Data" and the first three of "Edge Data".

-   It states that the Node Data is **active (Node data is on top of Edge data)**. The notion of an active tibble within a tbl_graph object makes it possible to manipulate the data in one tibble at a time.

### 27.4.6 Changing the active object

The nodes tibble data frame is activated by default, but you can change which tibble data frame is active with the *activate()* function. Thus, if we wanted to rearrange the rows in the edges tibble to list those with the highest "weight" first, we could use *activate()* and then *arrange()*.

For example,

```{r}
GAStech_graph %>% 
  activate(edges) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Weight))
```

Visit the reference guide of [*activate()*](https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/activate.html) to find out more about the function.

## 27.5 Plotting Static Network Graphs with **ggraph** package

[**ggraph**](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/) is an extension of **ggplot2**, making it easier to carry over basic ggplot skills to the design of network graphs.

As in all network graph, there are three main aspects to a **ggraph**'s network graph, they are:

-   [nodes](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggraph/vignettes/Nodes.html),

-   [edges](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggraph/vignettes/Edges.html) and

-   [layouts](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggraph/vignettes/Layouts.html).

For a comprehensive discussion of each of this aspect of graph, please refer to their respective vignettes provided.

### 27.5.1 Plotting a basic network graph

The code chunk below uses

-   [*ggraph()*](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/ggraph.html),

-   [*geom-edge_link()*](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/geom_edge_link.html) and

-   [*geom_node_point()*](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/geom_node_point.html) to plot a network graph by using *GAStech_graph*.

Before getting started, it is advisable to read their respective reference guide at least once.

```{r}
ggraph(GAStech_graph) +  #<<< GAStech_graph is a tbl_graph object
  geom_edge_link() +
  geom_node_point()
```

::: callout-note
## Things to learn from code chunk above

-   The basic plotting function is `ggraph()`, which takes the data to be used for the graph and the type of layout desired. Both of the arguments for `ggraph()` are built around *igraph*. Therefore, `ggraph()` canaccept either an *igraph* object or a *tbl_graph* object.

-   **`igraph`** uses an adjacency matrix or an edge list and is more focused on traditional graph theory algorithms and operations.

    In an edge list, each row represents an edge, with the first two columns containing the indices of the nodes that the edge connects.

-   **`tidygraph`** uses a **`tbl_graph`** object, which is a tidy data frame representation of a graph. The **`nodes`** and **`edges`** data frames contain the metadata about the nodes and edges, respectively, and can be manipulated using the **`dplyr`** syntax
:::

### 27.5.2 Changing the default network graph theme

In this section, use [*theme_graph()*](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/theme_graph.html) to remove the x and y axes. Before getting started, it is advisable to read it's reference guide at least once.

```{r}
g <- ggraph(GAStech_graph) +  #<<< GAStech_graph is a tbl_graph object
  geom_edge_link(aes()) +
  geom_node_point(aes())

g + theme_graph()
```

::: callout-note
## Things to learn form codes above

-   **ggraph** introduces a special ggplot theme that provides better defaults for network graphs than the normal ggplot defaults. `theme_graph()`, besides removing axes, grids, and border, changes the font to Arial Narrow (this can be overridden).
-   The ggraph theme can be set for **a series of plots** with the `set_graph_style()` command run before the graphs are plotted or by using `theme_graph()` in the **individual plots**.
:::

```{r}
class(g)
```

::: callout-note
Object **g** is a tbl graph object and is a dataframe with nodes, edges, and plot characteristics information. This dataframe changes everytime I overwrite **g**
:::

```{r}
g <- ggraph(GAStech_graph) +  #<<< GAStech_graph is a tbl_graph object
  geom_edge_link(aes(colour ='grey50'),show.legend = FALSE) +  #<< refer to ggraph documentation
  geom_node_point(aes(colour ='grey40'))

g + theme_graph(background = 'grey10',
                text_colour = 'orange')
```

### 27.5.4 Working with **ggraph**'s layouts

**ggraph** support many layout for standard used, they are: star, circle, nicely (default), dh, gem, graphopt, grid, mds, spahere, randomly, fr, kk, drl and lgl. Figures below and on the right show layouts supported by `ggraph()`.

![](https://r4va.netlify.app/chap27/img/image4.jpg){width="478"} ![](https://r4va.netlify.app/chap27/img/image5.jpg){width="478"}

### 27.5.5 Fruchterman and Reingold layout

The code chunks below will be used to plot the network graph using Fruchterman and Reingold layout.

**To change the layout of ggraphs, refer to [ggraph_layout](https://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/ggraph-introduction-layouts/)**

```{r}
g <- ggraph(GAStech_graph, layout='fr') +  #<<< refer to ggraph_layout link above
  geom_edge_link(aes()) +  #<< refer to ggraph documentation
  geom_node_point(aes())

g + theme_graph()
```

::: callout-note
## Things to learn from the codes above

-   *layout* argument is used to define the layout to be used.
:::

### 27.5.6 Modifying network nodes

In this section, I will colour each node by referring to their respective departments.

```{r}
g <- ggraph(GAStech_graph, layout='nicely') +  #<<< refer to ggraph_layout link above
  geom_edge_link(aes()) +  #<< refer to ggraph documentation
  geom_node_point(aes(colour=Department, size =3))

g + theme_graph()
```

::: callout-note
## Things to learn from the code

-   *geom_node_point* is equivalent in functionality to *geo_point* of **ggplot2**. It allows for simple plotting of nodes in different shapes, colours and sizes. In the codes chnuks above colour and size are used.
:::

### 27.5.7 Modifying edges

In the code chunk below, the thickness of the edges will be mapped with the *Weight* variable. [geom_edge_link](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggraph/versions/2.1.0/topics/geom_edge_link) search individually

```{r}
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-asp: 0.618
g <- ggraph(GAStech_graph, layout='nicely') +  #<<< refer to ggraph_layout link above
  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight, alpha= 0.2)) +  #<< thickness by weight and change alpha
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +  #<< control max size of edge , else my plot is ugly
  geom_node_point(aes(colour=Department, size =3))

g + theme_graph()
```

::: callout-note
## Things to learn from codes above

-   *geom_edge_link* draws edges in the simplest way - as straight lines between the start and end nodes. But, it can do more that that. In the example above, argument *width* is used to map the width of the line in proportional to the Weight attribute and argument alpha is used to introduce opacity on the line.
:::

The code chuck below assign colour to the nodes manually without hard-coding. I have also change the background and text colour.

-   activate the nodes df and extract the `unique` department using the `pull()` function

-   use `length()` function to find the nunique departments

-   **`brewer.pal()`** function generates a set of colors based on the number of unique departments

-   **`setNames()`** function is used to map the colors to the departments

-   **`scale_color_manual()`** function is used to apply the color mapping to the Department nodes.

```{r}
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-asp: 0.618
library(RColorBrewer)

# Get unique departments from data
departments <- unique(GAStech_graph %>% activate(nodes) %>% pull(Department))

# Generate color palette based on number of unique departments
num_departments <- length(departments)
color_palette <- brewer.pal(num_departments, "Set3")

# Create color mapping for Department nodes
color_mapping <- setNames(color_palette, departments)

# Create plot with color mapping
j <- ggraph(GAStech_graph, layout='fr') + 
     geom_edge_link(aes(alpha=0.1, colour='white'),show.legend = FALSE) +
     geom_node_point(aes(colour=Department), size = 3) +
     scale_color_manual(values = color_mapping) +
     theme_graph(background = 'grey10',text_colour = 'orange')
j
```

If choose to hard code, refer to the code chunk below. I have tried 'star' layout , wonder if the red adminstrative node in the middle is related to high centrality?

```{r}
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-asp: 0.618
ggraph(GAStech_graph, layout='star') + 
     geom_edge_link(aes()) +
     geom_node_point(aes(colour=Department), size =4) +
     scale_color_manual(values = c("Administration" = "red", 
                                   "Engineering" = "blue", 
                                   "Executive" = "green", 
                                   "Facilities" = "purple", 
                                   "Information Technology" = "yellow", 
                                   "Security" = "pink")) +
     theme_graph()

```

I have tried to color code the edges by Weekday. However this graph is hard to interpret due to overplotting. We should try to facet by Weekday instead.

```{r}
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-asp: 0.618
g <- ggraph(GAStech_graph) +  #<<< GAStech_graph is a tbl_graph object
  geom_edge_link(aes(alpha=0.2, colour=Weekday)) +
  geom_node_point()

g + theme_graph()
```

## 27.6 Creating facet graphs

Another very useful feature of **ggraph** is faceting. In visualising network data, this technique can be used to reduce edge over-plotting in a very meaning way by spreading nodes and edges out based on their attributes. In this section, you will learn how to use faceting technique to visualise network data.

There are three functions in ggraph to implement faceting, they are:

-   [*facet_edges()*](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/facet_edges.html) whereby nodes are always drawn in a panel even if the node data contains an attribute named the same as the one used for the edge facetting,

-   [*facet_nodes()*](https://r4va.netlify.app/chap27.html) whereby edges are only draw in a panel if both terminal nodes are present here, and

-   [*facet_graph()*](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/facet_graph.html) faceting on two variables simultaneously.

### 27.6.1 Working with *facet_edges()*

In the code chunk below, [*facet_edges()*](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/facet_edges.html) is used. Before getting started, it is advisable for you to read it's reference guide at least once. Also can refer to [*ggraph()*](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/ggraph.html).

```{r}
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-asp: 0.618
set_graph_style()   #<< using this command provide plot settings for next few plots

g <- ggraph(GAStech_graph, 
            layout = "nicely") + 
  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), 
                 alpha=0.2) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), 
                  size = 2)

g + facet_edges(~Weekday)
```

::: callout-note
## set_graph_style() defaults

Refer to [thomas85github_theme_graph](https://github.com/thomasp85/ggraph/blob/main/R/theme_graph.R)

-   set_graph_style

(family = 'Arial Narrow', face = 'plain', size = 11,

text_size = 11, text_colour = 'black', ...)

-   unset_graph_style() -- to reset the graph style to default
:::

### 27.6.2 Working with *facet_edges(): change legend position*

The code chunk below uses *theme()* to change the position of the legend.

```{r}
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-asp: 0.618
set_graph_style()

g<- ggraph(GAStech_graph,
            layout='nicely') +
  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight),
                     alpha=0.2) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1,5)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour=Department),
                  size =2) +
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')
                   
                   
g + facet_edges(~Weekday)
```

### 27.6.3 A framed facet graph

The code chunk below adds frame to each graph.

```{r}
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-asp: 0.618
set_graph_style()

g<- ggraph(GAStech_graph,
           layout='nicely') +
  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight),
                 alpha = 0.2) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1,5)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour=Department),
                  size = 2)

g + facet_edges(~Weekday) +
  th_foreground(foreground = 'steelblue',
                fg_text_colour = 'white',
                border = TRUE) +
  
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')
  
```

### 27.6.4 Working with *facet_nodes()*

In the code chunkc below, [*facet_nodes()*](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/facet_nodes.html) is used. Before getting started, it is advisable for you to read it's reference guide at least once.

```{r}
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-asp: 0.618
set_graph_style()

g<- ggraph(GAStech_graph,
           layout='nicely') +
  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight),
                 alpha = 0.2) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1,5)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour=Department),
                  size = 2)

g + facet_nodes(~Department) +
  th_foreground(foreground = 'steelblue',
                fg_text_colour = 'white',
                border = TRUE) +
  
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')
```

## 27.7 Network Metrics Analysis

### 27.7.1 Computing centrality indices

Centrality measures are a collection of statistical indices use to describe the relative important of the actors are to a network. There are four well-known centrality measures, namely: degree, betweenness, closeness and eigenvector. It is beyond the scope of this hands-on exercise to cover the principles and mathematics of these measure here. Students are encouraged to refer to *Chapter 7: Actor Prominence* of **A User's Guide to Network Analysis in R** to gain better understanding of theses network measures.

[Tidygraph documentation](https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/index.html) : so far we used `tbl_graph()` to create a tbl_graph network object / dataframe called GAStech_graph. Then we practise activate() to swtich between nodes and edges tibbles. This network obj is passed into ggraph() to plot the charts.

Now we are using tidy graph to perform centrality calculations.

[ggraph documentation](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/index.html)

```{r}
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-asp: 0.618
g <- GAStech_graph %>% 
  mutate(betweenness_centrality = centrality_betweenness()) %>% #<< tidygraph doc
  ggraph(layout='fr') +
  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight,
                     alpha= 0.2)) + 
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) + 
  geom_node_point(aes(colour=Department, size = betweenness_centrality))

g + theme_graph()
```

::: callout-note
## Things to learn from the code above

-   *mutate()* of **dplyr** is used to perform the computation and create a new col called betweenness_centrality. Use tidyverse commands on tidygraph object.

<!-- -->

-   the algorithm used, on the other hand, is the *centrality_betweenness()* of **tidygraph**.

### 27.7.2 Visualising network metrics (without computing col above)

It is important to note that from **ggraph v2.0** onward tidygraph algorithms such as centrality measures can be accessed directly in ggraph calls. This means that it is no longer necessary to precompute and store derived node and edge centrality measures on the graph in order to use them in a plot.

```{r}
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-asp: 0.618
set.seed (1234)
g <- GAStech_graph %>%
  ggraph(layout = "fr") + 
  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), 
                 alpha=0.2) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department, 
                      size = centrality_betweenness()))   #<<<< access betweenness values directly using `centrality_betweenness()`
g + theme_graph()
```

### 27.7.3 Visualising Community

tidygraph package inherits many of the community detection algorithms imbedded into igraph and makes them available to us, including *Edge-betweenness (group_edge_betweenness)*, *Leading eigenvector (group_leading_eigen)*, *Fast-greedy (group_fast_greedy)*, *Louvain (group_louvain)*, *Walktrap (group_walktrap)*, *Label propagation (group_label_prop)*, *InfoMAP (group_infomap)*, *Spinglass (group_spinglass)*, and *Optimal (group_optimal)*. Some community algorithms are designed to take into account direction or weight, while others ignore it. Use this [link](https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/group_graph.html) to find out more about community detection functions provided by tidygraph,

In the code chunk below *group_edge_betweenness()* is used

[thomas85/tidygraph/group](https://github.com/thomasp85/tidygraph/blob/main/R/group.R)

```{r}
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-asp: 0.618
set.seed (1234)
g <- GAStech_graph %>%
  mutate(community = as.factor(group_edge_betweenness(weights = Weight, directed = TRUE))) %>%
  ggraph(layout = "fr") + 
  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), 
                 alpha=0.2) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = community))  

g + theme_graph()
```

What does the n_groups() argument do? Set the number of communities?

```{r}
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-asp: 0.618
set.seed (1234)
g <- GAStech_graph %>%
  mutate(community = as.factor(group_edge_betweenness(weights = Weight, 
                                                      directed = TRUE, 
                                                      n_groups = 20))) %>%  #<< should i try to change the number of groups/community?
  ggraph(layout = "fr") + 
  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), 
                 alpha=0.2) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = community))  

g + theme_graph()

```
